HRTEM images confirm that a GdOx material exists as polycrystalline and thickness of GdOx layer is 17 nm. The GdOx film is also confirmed by EDS and XPS analyses. Large size of the 8-μm devices show better resistive switching charac- teristics as compared to those small size of the 0.4-μm devices at a CC of 300 μA under low operating voltage of ±4 V, which is due to higher oxygen recombination rate of oxygen with remaining conducting filament in the GdOx film as well as larger TE/GdOx interfacial area. Switching mechanism is based on formation and rupture of the oxygen vacancy conducting filaments through the GdOx grain boundaries. The 8-μm devices show repeatable switching cycles, good device-to-device uniformity, and long read pulse endurance of >105 cycles.

1,"Resistive switching behaviors in bio‐organic aloe polysaccharides films deposited from a solution process were explored for nonvolatile memory applications. Facile extraction of aloe polysaccharides from natural A. vera gel was demonstrated using a simple alcohol precipitation protocol. The extracted aloe polysaccharides were optimally dried into thin films at 120 °C, with well preservation of the biodegradable, biocompatible, and bioactive contents. The optimal drying temperature reported here is considered higher if compared to the normal processing temperature (≈70 °C) of natural A. vera gel. Such high drying temperature renders the bio‐organic material a competitive edge for integration into contemporary electronics processing. While resistive switching in bio‐organic MIM stacks are all bipolar, the aloe polysaccharides device is able to demonstrate both bipolar and unipolar resistive switching, depending on the TE materials used in the MIM stacks. The resistive switching behaviors of the polysaccharides device can be elucidated to three distinct switching mechanisms attributed to various electronic, electrochemical, and thermochemical processes in the aloe polysaccharides films. These electrically triggered physicochemical processes show great differences in terms of mobile charges, driving forces, switching regions, and switching processes. Coexistence of distinct switching mechanisms has never been the case for other bio‐organic devices.

The increase in C while R remains unchanged, before the reset transition, shows that the main phenomenon in the early stage of the reset process is the annihilation reaction of the oxygen va- cancy. The rapid increase of both C and R upon the reset transition is an obvious signature of the rupture of conduct- ing channels.

6,"A self-assembled 2D finned CuS was synthesized via RF Magnetron Sputtering on lightly n-doped Si. This finned material is mostly CuS with small amounts of Cu2S and elemental S. This sputter process streamlines the conventional wet chemical preparation technique, saving resources, yet obtaining low writing and reset voltages. Most importantly, it eliminates the need for multi-layered devices in order to exhibit ReRAM behaviour. The difference in resistance is 2 orders of magnitude within a negative biased effective region of 0.5 V to 0 V. The writing and reset processes were carried out at low voltages of 3 V and 1 V, within a duration of 20 ms. This memory is volatile and returns to a default state of lower resistance within 10 ms. The difference in resistance is hypothesised to be caused by a phase transition between CuS (low resistance) and more copper-rich copper sulfides (high resistance), a result of the polycrystalline finned structure of the CuS.",9,5_modeled_modeled using_nisi_dl

By finely tuning the applied pulse parameters, the device can emulate both short- and long-term plasticity. These types of artificial synapses emulate various biological synaptic plasticity by harnessing robust ferroelectric domain switching dynamics accompanied by the manipulation of the conductance states. One simple application by using both LTP and STP is emulating associative learning with the famous classical conditioning Pavlov’s dog experiments. More importantly, we think that coexistence of LTP and STP in the same device could enable designing efficient brainlike architectures. A simulated artificial neural network with supervised learning consisting of these synaptic devices exhibited very high learning accuracies of 96.5% for the UCI image data set and 96.4% for the MNIST handwritten data set.

In particular, these polymers showed memory behaviors over the exceptionally wide thickness window of <210 nm.

For all three devices the obtained results point towards filamentary mechanisms as the dominant conductance switching process. In strong contrast to many previous works, we were able to exclude contributions of π-conjugation and charge trapping. We suggest that unipolar resistance switching is a fundamental property of electrode/ organic/electrode systems, making this finding signifi cant for researchers working on other typical organic thin film ‘sandwich’ devices like organic photovoltaic devices or organic light emitting diodes, where the formation of parasitic pathways through the device doubtless is an undesired side-effect.",69,12_perovskite_thz_perovskites_interfacestate

From current-voltage curves and Vs for positive and negative voltage sweeps, HRS and Vs strongly depend on anode and are very similar for the same anode irrespective of the cathode. The conduction mechanism of HRS is proposed with three domains of CD, BD, and AD. The potential in AD due to the partial rupture of conducting filaments controls the conduction in HRS and governs Vs. This rupture makes the thick insulator act as a thin film, which confirms that the set voltage strongly depends on the anode.",25,13_inhibitory_brain_inhibitory neurons_spatiotemporal

17,"In conclusion, we have developed easy-to-grow nanoscaffold devices showing extraordinary field-dependent electroresistance at room temperature, using V."" localized at vertical heterointerfaces. The resistance variations exceed two orders of mag. nitude with very high uniformity and tunability. Using EELS, we found that oxygen deficient regions are readily confined at the vertical interface of the nanocolumns and the matrix, due to the structural incompatibility of dissimilar oxides. Regularly distributed and spatially confined V"" present in our films minimize the stray conduction channels, which are responsible for non-uniformity and non-reproducibility in single-phase oxides. The V."" engineering at the nanoscale by means of nanoscaffold structures spatially confines the conduction channels at vertical interfaces and gives better control over the device performance with high uniformity and reproducibility.

19,"In summary, we reported the light and electric field co-control of lattice-coupled functionalities using the welldesigned SRO/PMN-PT epitaxial heterostructures. The electric-field-induced converse piezoelectric effect of the PMN-PT substrate enables the in-plane lattice contraction of the SRO film, which, in turn, moderately reduces the film resistance. The electroresistance response can be tuned by 8.2% under light illumination. In contrast, the visible-lightinduced lattice expansion leads to a remarkable increase in the film resistance. Such a photoresistance effect was found to be electrically tunable. These results reveal that the light and the electric field strongly couple with each other, which can be reasonably interpreted by strain/lattice distortion modulation of orbital hybridization between the Ru 4d orbitals and O 2p orbitals.

29,"Over the past decade, the versatile MOFs with well-defined crystal structure and rich structural tunability showed great potential and special advantages in proton conductor applications. Moreover, their crystalline nature may offer distinct opportunities to investigate the proton transport mechanism by employing the X-ray diffraction techniques, which can be served as an exciting guideline for further designing and synthesizing new type of MOF-based proton conductors. Herein, the surveyed samples have covered various effective strategies for achieving high proton conductivity in many promising MOFs. First, we chose several representative MOFs as platforms (e.g.,MIL-101, UiO-66, HKUST-1, and β-PCMOF-2), and elaborated that some universal or unique strategies can be used to improve their proton conductive performances. Then, we elaborated on the concept and importance of wide operating temperature range (especially for working under sub-zero temperature) for proton conductors, such materials displayed typical proton conductive behaviors under anhydrous atmosphere.

30,"Although MOF materials have made great progress in the application of proton conductors, even the conductivity values of some superior candidates (>0.1 S cm −1 , Table 1) are higher than the commercial Nafion materials (>10 −2 S cm −1 ), there are many remaining opportunities and challenges in this field. i) The water and thermal stability of such material has been greatly improved, however, their mechanical strength and processability have not received sufficient consideration. ii) Alkyl chain linear polymer functionalized organic ligands can be used to fabricate new type of poly-MOF-based proton conductor to ameliorate their mechanical properties and processability. iii) The linear polymers (e.g., polyaniline, poly(vinyl alcohol), and poly(acrylic acid)) were prepared through the in situ strategy within the MOF channel, which might not only provide a continuous pathway for proton conduction but also promote the assembly performance of the membrane electrode. iv) For some unique MOF samples, due to their structural disorder or defect, limited knowledge of the proton transfer mechanisms restricts their rational manufacturing. In situ experiments and/or advanced characterization techniques (e.g., quasi-elastic neutron scattering and solid-state NMR), and theoretical calculations would be combined to investigate the proton conduction mechanism. v) The incorporation of new types of proton carriers within the pore or the employment of external stimuli might be beneficial for improving the proton conduction performances of such materials. [123,166] On the other hand, the conductive MOFs with switchable behavior can be applied as chemical sensor to detect external stimuli, such as gas, [167,168] light irradiation, electric and magnetic field. vi) The latest study has shown that MOF with switched hydrogen bond pathway may simultaneously achieve resistive switching and rectifying effects, [169] such material can be used as resistive random-access memory (RRAM) for information storage.

The low temperature shoulder- like origin of sub-quantum conductance changes to a strong plateau at higher temperatures. The device structure, materials, and ﬁlament geometry can control the occurrence of the 0.7 anomaly in RRAM. In addition, the Lorentzian ZBA peak is present only at LRS, while the peak signal is silent at HRS.

Without the pre-forming process, a smooth transition (‘‘soft’’ switch) of both ohmic bipolar and rectifying unipolar (bipolar) behavior was detected. The reliable forming process leads to the abrupt switching of the structure. Electrical characterization of the Al/graphene oxide interface with high spatial resolution using the induced current technique revealed a potential barrier near the interface and its spatial modulation, caused by local changes of resistance under applied voltages. The local changes of resistance in the layer near the Al/GO interface under a bias voltage as a result of sp3 to sp2 structure reconstruction are assumed to be responsible for the observed resistive switching. The mechanism of the resistive switching in the structure is supposed to be related to the electrodiffusion of oxygen and the formation of sp2 graphene clusters in the sp3 insulating graphene oxide layer formed near the electrode by a pre-forming process.",32,33_pcm_pcm logic_cmos logic_clock

It is shown that after exposure supply currents are essentially unaffected and also that no errors are observed in the data stored in the CBRAM memory arrays for TID levels up to 447 krad. These results demonstrate that CBRAM technology solutions exhibit a superior tolerance to TID than traditional Flash-based memory circuits. This could be related to the unique data storage mechanism in CBRAM, where information is stored as a conductive bridge in a dielectric/electrolyte material and not as charges in a floating gate like in the traditional NVMs circuits. Formation and removal of conductive filaments provide a high dynamic range that may contribute to this increased performance. In novel commercial memories like FRAM and MRAM the dynamic range is much smaller than that of CBRAM, making those technologies more sensitive to errors caused by external stresses such as a high energy radiation which impact the CMOS circuitry and how well this circuitry is able to detect/read ON or OFF states.",23,38_nucleus_ncrit_characteristic breakdown_critical nucleus
40,"A high dynamic range might not be the only requirement for improved TID performance, but rather a high dynamic range with a LRS resistance high enough to minimize any TID induced stand-by current variation. In the CBRAM circuit, the memory cells are implemented with 1 transistor - 1 PMC structures (1T-1R). While in the HRS state (i.e., OFF), the resistance value of the memory cell is very high and even if the transistor exhibits a variation of its characteristics due to TID (e.g., an increase of leakage current), current flow is limited by the cells’ resistance. This maintains a low leakage current and an unaffected stand-by current. In the case of the memory cell being in the ON state, if the resistance value used to represent the ON state is low enough, leakage current could flow through the 1T-1R cell contributing to a variation of the stand-by current. In the case of the CBRAM device tested, the LRS resistance state is high enough so that leakage currents are not increased dramatically and do not contribute to increased stand-by current.",23,39_neuronal_nonideal characteristics_nonideal_diversity

Utilizing cooling in electric ﬁelds from elevated temperatures at 61 V, a maximum TER ratio of 490 % was achieved. Based on the temperature-dependent TER ratio, change of the average barrier height, and shifting of the localized states energy, we attribute the TER origin to a reversal of the MgZnO electric polarization. From the theoretical calculations, the polarization switching was found to be consistent with the simultaneous displacement of Zn and O atoms. In particular, the tunnel barrier height increased at the interface with Pt3Co layer after the polarization reversal to P–.

It likely originates from (1) an Ohmic or quasiOhmic contact at the ZnO/Pt interface and (2) a Schottky contact at the Ti/ZnO interface. The Ohmic contact is due to the reduction of ZnO occurring in the whole film instead of only at the Ti/ZnO interface. The Schottky contact may be due to moisture adsorbed in the nanoporous ZnO. The conduction in the electroformed device was found to be controlled by the carrier trapping/detrapping of the trap sites, resulting in a poor rectification and high nonlinearity. In addition, a complementary resistive switching was obtained by connecting two Ti/ZnO/Pt devices anti-serially.",45,42_solid electrolyte_pinched hysteresis_pinched_nanofilaments

45,"In conclusion, we proposed a simple model for describing resistive switching of RRAM dielectrics assuming the same multi-phonon assisted electron tunneling mechanism for both high resistance state and low resistance state. Switching from high resistive state to low resistive state is explained by the drastic increase in the concentration of traps and corresponding increase in electron tunneling probability between neighboring traps. We suggest that primarily trap in GeO2 is an oxygen vacancy, which is the most widely acknowledged defect in dielectrics such as SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, HfO2, Ta2O3, TiO2. Using the proposed model, we obtained the value of trap thermal ionization energy Wt = 1.42 eV, which is in very good agreement with theoretically calculated energy level for oxygen vacancy 1.5 eV. Obtained value for electron tunnel effective mass m* = 0.2 me is twice lower compared to theoretically calculated effective mass for the free conduction band electron but is close to experimentally determined tunnel effective masses for other high-k dielectrics.",1,44_agtcnq_bi_uvozone_nio reram

The bipolar switching characteristics were observed, and the trapping/de-trapping mechanism was suggested to be responsible for the switching processes.

We found that the optimum Hf thickness was around 10 nm to obtain a high yield of memory operation. When the Hf thickness was very small ( ∼2 nm ), the device failed after the first RESET process owing to the very large RESET current. In the case of a very thick Hf layer ( ∼20 nm ), RESET did not occur owing to the formation of the conductive oxide layer. We observed multiple resistance states when we increased the voltage stepwise in the RESET process. There is some possibility of using this device for multiple - resistance - states memory, and further study of the stability and endurance of multiple resistance states would be required.",5,46_framework_geometrical_deterministic_cellbased
48,"Here, we have demonstrated the RS properties of ITO/ ZnO/p-type Si devices. A difference in current of more than 5 orders of magnitude is observed between LRS and HRS, with endurance beyond 10^3 cycles, while working at low voltages. The analysis of the intensity-voltage curves has shown the formation of CNFs at the set process due to out-diffusion of O atoms, which is responsible for the LRS. In the reset process, these CNFs are interrupted along 9 nm by their re-oxidation, recovering the ZnO defective layer in this region. The fact that this region is in the range of some nanometers propitiated the observed high stability of the RS cycle in these devices. Overall, ZnO, when combined with a p-type Si substrate and an ITO top electrode, is demonstrated as an excellent candidate for a future generation of RS memories, whose combination with other Si-based devices provides a large range of applications in transparent electronics.",7,47_msp_lsp_cams_sns2

All of the features are interpreted by the oxygen ions migration between PCMO film and W BE across YSZ layer, and the improvement of RS properties may be mainly attributed to the modulation of tunneling barrier YSZ layer during the RS process.

The partial substitution of the La3+ ion with a smaller Gd3+ ion led to Sr2+ cation vacancy as an A-site defect due to ionic size mismatch, which induced favorable conditions for electrochemical migration and redox of oxygen ions due to the reduced migration barrier, Eeff.

55,"We will now discuss the variation in the switching time v with V and I. Previous studies in Ag/a-Si:H (Ref. 9) and in Ag  GeS2 (Ref. 10) have shown that v varies exponentially with V (Cu diffusion controlled kinetics). This is not ob- served here [see Fig. 2(b)]. In the present work we probe long v (10+3 – 10−1 s range, low programming voltages), while previous studies9,10 probed short v (10−1 – 10−5 s range, large programming voltages). Such a difference could confirm that, according to the bias voltage, different mecha- nisms control the switching kinetics.11 Here, the switching time measured in the CVS mode is best described by an exp(V0  V) law (Fig. 4). To explain v(V)~ exp(V0  V), sev- eral hypothesis can be formulated. This law agrees with the nucleation theory of Karpov and co-workers.12 These authors calculated the nucleation time of prolate nucleus which, due to a large internal polarization (shape effect), have a reduced free energy and so a reduced induction time. Calculations lead to a nucleation time which varies as exp(E0  E), where E is the electric field.12 Independently, this kind of law is ob- served when studying breakdown phenomena in SiO2, where the logarithm of the time-to-breakdown varies with 1/E (the “1/E model”).13,14 Chen et al..14 proposed the following in- terpretation. High fields lead to Fowler–Nordheim (tunnel- ing) electronic injection at the cathode. Accelerated electrons ionize SiO2 (impact ionization) creating holes which migrate and accumulate at the cathode. The hole space charge at the cathode further enhances the field, creating more electronic injection, and the system is driven to breakdown. The key rate-limiting process in this model is tunneling injection at the cathode, which gives the exp(E0  E) law. It was later observed that Cu electrodes considerably reduce the time-to- breakdown in silicon oxides.15 A refined 1/E model was pro- posed which takes Cu diffusion into account, whose role is to reduce the gap between the anode and the cathode and to enhance E (this is similar to the formation of a conducting filament). As a third explanation, the exp(V0  V) law (rooted to a Fowler–Nordheim injection) could arise from electron injection at the filament tip (cathode) which neutral- izes Cu ions coming from the anode. Thus, the growth kinet- ics of Cu filaments would be limited by the electrocrystalli- zation of Cu at the filament tip, as already suggested by Schindler and co-workers2 (the difference is that we observe a Fowler–Nordheim tunneling injection law, while previous 2 authors observed a barrier-limited Butler–Volmer injection law). Finally, in the CCS mode, v is observed to vary with 1/I (Fig. 4). This shows that switching kinetics is driven by the amount of charge injected, consistent with all the above models (nucleation, defects induced soft-breakdown, or Cu electrocrystallization).",-1,54_wires_ncsi_ncsi wires_electrothermal
56,"A general framework for the analysis and modeling of resistive switching statistical data has been successfully established. This framework is inspired in the analogy with the percolation model of oxide breakdown and is based on two elements: (1) a cell-based geometrical description of the switching conducting filament and (2) a deterministic physicsbased model describing the dynamics of the underlying SET and RESET phenomena. As a first example, we have shown the validity of this approach through its application to the modeling of the RESET statistics of Pt/NiO/W RRAM devices. We have proposed two simple geometrical cell-based models: the single path model (with variable width) and the single-cell-wide multiple path model. These geometrical models are used to link the RESET cumulative distribution function to the probability of cell out-diffusion from the CF. Then, a deterministic model of cell out-diffusion based on the selfaccelerated thermal dissolution model has been developed and incorporated into the cell-based models to construct a complete analytical model for the statistics of RESET voltage, current, and power. Given the independence of the scale factor of the VRESET distribution on the ON-state resistance of the LRS, the limit of switching in a short constriction (only one cell long) has been considered. In this limit, both cell-based representations of the CF are found to be equivalent, and a simple Weibull model for the switching statistical variables has been established. The Weibull slopes of VRESET, IRESET, and PRESET are found to be equal and proportional to the number of cells n, which define the total width of the constriction or the number of parallel paths which form the CF, bV ¼ bI ¼ 2bP ¼ ðm þ 1Þan. This means that the Weibull slopes increase linearly with 1=RON. These results are remarkably consistent with the experimental observations regarding the scaling of the shape and scale parameters of the cumulative distribution of the RESET voltage, current, and power as a function of RON. In order to stress the generality of our general framework, let us briefly discuss how the approach followed to model the RESET statistics can also be easily modified to deal with the statistics of FORMING and SET operations. However, the detailed modeling of the SET and FORMING is left for future work. The model for the FORMING statistics is likely to be very similar to that described for the breakdown statistics, because the FORMING process is very similar (if not exactly the same) to that of the oxide breakdown. The geometrical picture for describing the SET statistics is closely related to the state of the dielectric after RESET. After RESET, the filament is broken and there is a gap separating the electrodes. The shortest gap among those existing between the remaining CFs after RESET and the opposite electrode will determine the SET switching. As a consequence, the geometrical model required to describe the SET transition might be an equivalent oxide with thickness equal to the minimum gap and area equal to that of the partially destroyed CF. The deterministic models for the SET operation in different kinds of devices might be different. In the case of VCM devices, the deterministic model will consider defect generation dynamics (vacancy generation and transport) similar to that occurring during oxide breakdown. In the case of ECM structures, the compact model developed by Wong and Yu at Stanford University19 might be a reasonable starting assumption. For a correct assessment of our approach, it is worth noting that our model is able to relate the initial resistance of the CF with the distribution of SET/RESET parameters. However, the model does not provide any information in the reverse direction, i.e., it does not allow us to model the distribution of ON and OFF resistances. Our proposed framework allows an improved physics-based understanding of the RS mechanisms and set up a basis for the consideration of performance-reliability tradeoffs.",46,55_weibull_sna sg_sna_sn sna
57,"In conclusion, RRAM devices were fabricated by ALD of Ta2O5 doped with fluorine. Density functional modeling of the atomic structures and calculation of the density of states using sX hybrid functional correction show that the oxygen vacancies are substituted with F atoms, resulting in the passivation of the oxygen vacancy and removal of the defect state in the midgap of the oxide. The dc and ac sweep setreset measurements show that passivation of oxygen vacancies increases the switching memory window and state stability, which has been attributed to the elimination of excess conductive filaments. The stability of states and the separation of states at various set currents indicated that the device is suitable for MLC switching applications.

58,"In conclusion, the influence of DF on the RS behaviors of MOMs was investigated using SCO films with and without defect concentration gradients. The homogeneous DFs in SCO accelerate the production of unrecoverable fragments at the SCO/ Pt interface, which reduce the interfacial barriers and further lead to the fatigue of HRS. However, the reduced barriers improve the fluctuation in HRS. Bilayer SCO devices with DF concentration gradients were fabricated to restrain HRS fatigue because the Fick force resulting from the defect concentration gradient can drive Om to reduce unrecoverable fragments. When the Fick force dominates the diffusion of Om, the bilayer devices demonstrate increased resistance and stuck RS due to the overfilling of interfacial vacancies. These results indicate that the RS behaviors of MOMs can be modulated by designing Frenkel defects gradient.",4,57_dendrite_rh_lmo_1s

The light-responsive hydrogel functions as an obstacle to separate the oxide and the aqueous solution or biofluids, which limits water permeation through the oxide layer, leading to prolonged stable operation time of transient electronics. More important, the gel-to-sol transition of hydrogel under UV light provides the controllability of triggering the degradation. The required minimum thickness of the oxide layer to effectively implement this new encapsulation strategy was analyzed, which can be used as a design guideline for further research.

In terms of the temperature sensors, various types of temperature sensors with different ranges are available, but only in a few cases, the temperature sensor, used as a wearable sensor, is extensively classifi ed for bodytemperature variation. Temperature sensors still have limitations in responsivity to temperature ranging from 30 °C to 50 °C (temperature range of human body), stretchability, and stability.

However, there are limitations in the power generation and power capacity of current fl exible and stretchable generators and power-storage devices. The current level of power generation and power capacity is far below the requirements for practical applications. Therefore, the production of a sensor-integrated wearable platform with low-power consumption, a wearable power generator with high output effi ciency, and a power-storage device with a large capacity remains potential for future research. In addition, integrating sensor-integrated wearable platforms with other components, such as data storage (memory), data-transmission systems (wireless), and stimulators (electrotactile) for longterm continuous recording, delivering signals of physiological responses from the human body to a machine for analysis, and transferring feedback information from a machine to a human, have been signifi cantly improved for monitoring human activity and for personal-healthcare applications. However, a technique to integrate multiple components into a wearable platform is also a considerable challenge. For example, the diversity in the components with different electrical and mechanical properties and mismatches in the Young’s moduli of dissimilar materials (resulting in delamination between layers by repetitive mechanical deformation during system operation), and the different form factors of component devices, restrict seamless integration with the skin, giving rise to wearability challenges and signal-to-noise limitations.",36,65_disorder_gesb2te4_disorderinduced_pcms

In lateral devices, the directionality of the dislocation does not favor the current path. However, we do observe resistive switching on such lateral devices and furthermore we observe resistive switching even in the complete absence of dislocations. In these cases, conducting filaments forming due to point defects16,28 such as oxygen vacancies or titanium interstitials could be playing a role.

The amount of electric power that is dissipated is tightly controlled by the current limitation. Breakdown results in enhanced conductivity that decays overtime in a self-healing process. The dependence of the recovery of the insulating properties on applied bias and illumination indicates that the enhanced conduction is due to an electrical bilayer structure consisting of trapped holes in the oxide layer and electrons in the polymer layer and that the self-healing is due to recombination of charges comprising the bilayer structure.,52,75_cryostat_cable_substation_superconductor

A clear resistance switching memory cycle was observed at RT when input voltage pulse sequences were applied to devices with the secondary Si barrier layer of 0–10 nm thickness. A typical switching voltage lower than 1V, a peak current density of 30–72 kA/cm2, and an ON/OFF ratio of approximately 1.9–30 were obtained. The retention time was almost entirely determined by the breakdown lifetime, which was measured to be 138 h. It was found that the retention time can be expanded to longer than 316 h by applying bias during the hold period, which strongly indicates that the limiting factor for retention is the internal built-in field.

78,"Large memory window resistive switching behavior was observed in ZnO nanoisland resistive memories. Redox-controlled conducting filament formation/rupture consisting of oxygen vacancies, which is regarded as a possible mechanism for resistive memories at the macroscopic scale, was proven through various electrical and imaging results to also be responsible for the switching behavior of the ZnO nanoisland resistive memory with a dimension of as small as 20 nm. Furthermore, C-AFM results have revealed that the conducting filaments are formed on the edges of ZnO nanoisland and can have a size on the order of 5 nm, suggesting that ZnO-based RRAM is a promising technology for future nonvolatile memory at the scaled technology",21,
79,"In summary, we experimentally demonstrated the effect of ferroelectric PZT on an epitaxial PCMO/Nb:STO p-n junction. A device formed of a PCMO/Nb:STO p-n junction structure without using the active PZT layer showed only a rectifying I-V characteristic, without any hysteresis. The integration of ferroelectric PZT with the epitaxially grown PCMO/Nb:STO heterostructure demonstrated excellent resistive switching performance, overcoming the inherent slow switching, unstable resistance state retention, and high power device operation that have been reported in metal/ Nb:STO Schottky contact structure15 or in metal/ferroelec- tric/Nb:STO structure16 or in reactive metal/PCMO based memory devices.",17,
80,"In summary, bias polarity dependency of I-V sweeps on a HRS cell demonstrated the existence of a Schottky barrier. The activation energies for electric conduction through a HRS cell in air and in a highly oxygen deficient environment a high vacuum measured by impedance spectroscopy were 0.05–0.15 eV and 0.5–0.8 eV, respectively. In the HRS films,two discrete regions with different RC values in the same cell were often found to exist in series with each other with activation energies of 0.1 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively. Considering that higher oxygen vacancy concentration around the interface tends to decrease the barrier height and that the Ti3+ centers frequently encountered in a reducing environment have defect energy levels similar to the measured activation energies, the low Ea 0.05–0.15 eV and the high Ea 0.5–0.8 eV were assigned to conduction through the Schottky barrier and electron traps in the film, respectively. The much smaller activation energy 0.05 eV in an LRS cell suggests a considerable lowering of the Schottky barrier down to a negligible level as well as a significant decrease in electron traps by the fluent electron injection.",-1,
81,"In conclusion, the electrical properties of CNT-NGJs and peapod-NGJs were investigated. NDR effects were clearly observed in the I–V curves of peapod-NGJs measured in a vacuum chamber. A memory effect was also demonstrated for the peapod-NGJ. From a comparison of peapods and SWCNTs, it can be concluded that the migration of fullerene molecules affects the NDR and NGS effect. Moreover, considering the results of the number of nanogaps cut in the SWCNTs of a peapod-NGJ, the smallest number of bridged peapods consisted of approximately five SWCNTs and the device was of true nanoscale size.",69,
82,"In conclusion, we demonstrated how an ITO electrode doped with the rare earth metal erbium can dramatically affect RRAM performance. Experimental results show that the ITO:Er device has a lower operation current and larger memory window. In addition, the RESET voltage increases but the SET voltage shows almost no difference compared to those of the pure ITO electrode. Schottky emission conduction dominates in both the LRS and HRS in the ITO:Er device, from which we conclude that the Schottky conduction mechanism originates in a difference in barrier height between the filament and electrode. A conduction model and energy band diagram explain the resistance switching mechanism of the Er-doped ITO electrode and are confirmed by material analysis and reliability tests.",30,
83,"It is demonstrated to write and read the device in excess of thousands times with a little fluctuation of resistive states as shown in Fig. 4a.

The strategy also greatly reduces device write cur rent. Distinct characteristics of the device may be useful for designing memritive analog and neuromorphic circuits. This is only the first step toward a large passive crossbar, further works are still in demand to increase on/off ratio and de crease Isneak /Iread ratio of the device.",53,
85,"In summary, we investigated the multilevel RS in TiO2 films. From the I-V measurements, we observed intermediate metastable states during reset of the unipolar RS. Compared to conducting AFM studies, we found that both the conduct- ing area and the current flow per unit area decreased during the multilevel RS. These changes at the macroscopic and microscopic levels were explained using the RCB network model. Considering the nature of the percolation process, it would not be easy to control arbitrarily the multistates of resistance in devices with the capacitor geometry.",34,
86,"In summary, uniform colloidal MoS2 nanosheets were synthesized at large-scale by using a hot-injection process, and their physical and chemical properties were extensively characterized by TEM, XRD, XPS, and UV–vis and Raman spectroscopy. The statistical analysis of the characterization data confirmed that the synthesized MoS2 nanosheets exhibit significantly higher morphological uniformity than exfoliated MoS2. Such material uniformity allowed the wafer-scale fabrication of a MoS2 RRAM array with excellent and uniform performance. It also enables the fabrication of a novel flexible data storage and display system with mechanical data writing and optical data reading functions. These advances will provide many new opportunities in the fabrication of wearable and/or mobile electronics.",66,
87,We investigated the transport properties of NiO thin films epitaxially grown on MgO 001_x0002_ substrate when varying the ambient atmosphere. The electrical conductivity of the fabricated NiO thin films showed an opposite tendency compared to the general trend of bulk p-type conduction mechanism. Microstructural analysis demonstrated that the electrical conduction of NiO thin films strongly correlates with tailing the band edge via the degradation of the entire film crystallinity rather than the grain boundaries including secondary phases and the bulk p-type conduction mechanism.,29,
88,"In summary, we reported a novel method to control the fragmentation of Ag NW network by the combination of UV/ozone irradiation and low temperature annealing. Because of the heat and ozone atmosphere generated by UV/ozone irradiation, an inhomogeneous surface oxidation on Ag NWs took place and the thermal-induced fragmentation could preferentially occur at the Ag/AgOx interfacial sites. It was found that prolonging the UV/ozone treatment time led to more AgOx and Ag NWs underwent a unique morphological evolution from nanowires to short segments or even chains of tiny Ag nanoparticles. Because of this unique morphology, the devices show volatile threshold switching characteristics with a high and stable selectivity of 5 × 105 when applying voltage. Meanwhile, the dominant switching mechanism is attributed to tunnelling process between the Ag fragments. Moreover, the threshold voltage (Vth) can be modulated simply by morphology control. This work demonstrated that the resistive switching application of Ag NW network can be explored by a controllable fragmentation.  ",44,
89,"In summary, TS of Si-As-Te thin film was examined. Optimization of the composition was required to achieve the TS behavior. Increase of Te resulted in an increase of the off-state current and threshold voltage, which is attributed to the increase of the concentration of defects and an increase of the generation rate by the decreased band-gap. By externally connecting the Si-As-Te threshold switch and the TiO2 unipolar resistive memory, it was possible to decrease the leakage current through the SET-state memory at 60.5V from several mA to several tens of lA, suggesting that Si-As-Te thin film can act as a selector device for crossbararray ReRAM.",-1,
90,"In summary, we developed a picture describing the observed memristive behavior in hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanowire devices. The resistance changes at the highest resistive part, which has been shown to be at the bottom of the nanowire. Ovac accumulation at the FTO interface and at the ends of the grain boundaries leads to a change in the resistance due to an interface barrier lowering and an overall shortening of the high resistive bulk part of the NRAs. Time-dependent measurements show a volatile behavior for the nanowire memristors, which is also visible in the IV-behavior. The volatility is related to the redistribution of Ovac over time, resulting in a loss of the written memristive state. Increasing the nanowire growth temperature leads to a better stoichiometry, which results in an increased lifetime of the memristive state. Since for lower growth temperatures the retention time could not be increased further, a saturation of Ovac accumulation is observed. The high defect densities for low growth temperatures lead to a faster saturation of accumulated Ovac, which can then redistribute faster.",28,
91,"It was demonstrated that Ti3C2Tx-OP MXene is a candidate for nonvolatile ternary memory devices and exhibits excellent flexibility. It displays easy-of-operation surface modification engineering, a simple device structure, a long retention time (4000 s), a high ON/OFF rate, OFF/ON1/ON2 = 1:102.7:104.1, and good ternary yield (58%), as well as outstanding flexibility. Therefore, this research broadens the fields of Ti3C2Tx-OP MXene and shows a new direction for memory for massive information. In addition, the study of flexible Ti3C2Tx-OP MXene memory devices has extreme significance for the development and application of flexible electronic devices.",66,
92,"In conclusion, the BFO/NSTO/GaAs heterostructure has  been fabricated by PLD. The temperature-dependent current-  voltage characteristics of the heterostructure reveal a resist-  ance switching phenomenon and diode-like behavior with a rectifying ratio of 2 × 10 at the applied voltage of 613.4 V. Combined with the energy band structure, the electrical  transport mechanism could be attributed to the ferroelectric  polarization modulation effect on the width of depletion  region and then influence the height of potential barrier at  the BFO/NSTO interface.

93,"The two bipolar switching modes CW and CCW_x0002_ were observed in Al/TiO2 / Pt and Pt/TiO2 /Al MIM structures, depending on the position of the Al electrode, either bottom or top. The redox reaction and trap/detrap at the Al/TiO2 interface lead to the bipolar resistive switching that is not usually observed in binary oxide materials. The nature of resistive switching phenomena in various binary oxide materials seems to be explained by a combination of the bulk effect such as the filamentary conduction path_x0002_ and the interface effect such as the redox reaction by oxygen ions and the trap/detrap of electrons_x0002_ that occur between the metal electrode and oxide materials.",44,

97,"A prototype of resistive switching device with sandwiched structure between GO and CuO ﬁlms has been fabricated and  examined. A fast resistive switching response with step-like performance was observed in IeV characteristics measurement. A possible  explanation is that the set voltages of GO is lower than that of the  CuO. Consequently, charge carriers of GO ﬁlm are accumulated at the  interface between GO and CuO ﬁlms until the voltage reaches to the  set value. At set voltage, accumulated charge carriers pass through  the ﬁlaments in CuO abruptly. It leads to the step-like switching  behavior in CuO/GO/CuO memory structure. It is suggested that  sandwiched structure of materials with different set voltage enables  to meliorate switching response characteristics of ReRAM.",41,
98,"In summary, the Al-rich AlxOy layer formed by partially anodizing Al thin film showed unipolar and repeatable switching between the LRS and the HRS with a high resistance ratio (>10^4) . The switching occurred without the requirement of a forming process, which is attributed to the pre-existing CFs in the Al-rich AlxOy layer. Both the LRS and HRS in low voltage region exhibited Ohmic behavior which can be explained by the metallic conduction and electron hopping from one isolated state to the next in the Al-rich AlxOy layer. The MIM structure consisting of the Al-rich AlxOy layer showed good memory characteristics.",24,

The FESEM image shows smooth and uniform surface morphology of the deposited layer. I–V characterization of the fabricated device promises the memristive behavior in the sandwich structure. The switching mechanism in the fabricated device is attributed to the ohmic conduction during high and low states of the ITO/ MEH:PPV/Ag sandwich. Endurance test and non-volatility of the fabricated sandwich device has been examined as well for its application feasibility and found to be satisfactory.,42,

101,"In summary, the behavior of filamentary ionic migration by electric fields was directly visualized in an epitaxial BCFO thin film. Multiple ionic transport devices with different channel orientations were fabricated to investigate the anisotropic features of ionic migration in the epitaxial film. We observed the nucleation and propagation of dark CFs in real time and found that the filaments prefer to grow along crystal axes h100i with a slight deviation to the E-field, providing useful information on the structure of oxygen vacancy channels. Sequential branching occurs so that the pattern is expanded into a self-similar structure. It was another interesting feature that the type of the ionic migration was changed from the filament growth mode to the bulk conduction mode when the areal density of filaments at the active electrode reached 30%. The findings offer tremendous opportunities for understanding collective defect migration in crystalline solids.",29,

104,"In conclusion, LiNbO3 thin films with a thickness of 600 nm were ion-exfoliated from Z-cut LiNbO3 single crystal. After annealing in Ar or in vacuum, electro-forming takes place, indicating that local conductive filaments are formed. The subsequent resistive switching shows rectifying filamentary switching properties, which is due to the fact that the filaments composed by oxygen vacancies do not penetrate throughout the LiNbO3 film. The present work proves that highly reproducible electro-forming and resistive switching can be obtained on single crystalline oxide thin films, which is potentially applicable in high-density memories requiring uniform performance among different cells.",7,
105,"In summary, this report is the first on 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction films for RS devices. The 2D/3D perovskite device exhibits an endurance of ∼2700 cycles, which is about 9 times longer than that of the pristine 3D perovskite device. The comparatively high hopping activation energy of the 2D/ 3D perovskite device (0.150 vs 0.135 eV of 3D perovskite) checks the Ag ion migration into the 3D perovskite film, resulting in the formation of a narrow Ag conductive filament. In addition, the 2D films exhibited a thermal conductivity of 1.18 W m−1 K−1 , which is about 4 times higher than that of the 3D films (0.28 W m−1 K−1 ); this could control the rupture of the Ag conductive filament during the reset process. Consequently, the 2D/3D perovskite was designed to significantly enhance the endurance and stability by controlling the Ag ion migration and filament rupture. Our results suggested that the 2D/3D perovskite film can improve the endurance of the HP-based RS memory devices.",12,
106,"In conclusion, bipolar resistive switching was reproduced for Pt/H2O/Ag cells. The switching-on process consists of the following steps: oxidation of metallic Ag, migration of Ag+ ions to the Pt electrode, and reduction of Ag^(+) ions on the Pt electrode. Ag dendrites grow from the Pt electrode toward the Ag electrode. Once the front-most dendrite contacts the Ag electrode, the cell is switched on. The switching-off process sets in when the voltage is reversed. It starts by the electrochemical dissolution of Ag atoms in the contacting dendrite. A numerical simulation shows that the dissolution starts at the neck where the dendrite contacts the solid surface, leading to a fast retreating of the dendrite. The tremendous curvature difference between the dendrite and the planar Ag bulk constitutes the reason for the bipolar switching of the cell. The switching on/off mechanism proposed in our model cells is especially meaningful for the bipolar resistive switching observed in ionic/mixed conductors.",57,
107,"In conclusion, the operation voltages  and the resistance  window in Y2O3-based RRAM show high thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Investigating the temperature dependence of the electrical characteristics revealed that the distribution of the set and reset voltages as  well as the high and low resistive state resistances becomes narrower  with increasing temperature. For all devices and test temperatures, the operation voltage window was found to span from —2V to 1V. It has been conﬁrmed that resistive switching in the investigated devices is  based on the valence change mechanism as both resistive states exhibit  semiconducting behavior. The LRS charge transport shows ohmic  conduction, whereas the HRS conduction is characterized by  Schottky-emission. The obtained effective Schottky-barrier height was found to increase from ~1.02 eV at 25 ○C to ~1.35 eV at 125 ○C and has been associated with barrier height inhomogeneity at the interface.",41,

The Laser-PEEM with the pulse–voltage application system makes it possible to observe the fine and dynamic changes in the device, and will help us understand the operation mechanism and the improvement of device operations.",1,
109,"In summary, we have proposed to centralize/decentralize the CF distribution to modulate the conductive filament stability of cation-based resistive switching devices by defective graphene. Two kinds of defective graphene, one with concentrated defects in the form of a nanohole and the other with discrete atomic-scale defects, are introduced into the typical AE/RS/IE structure between AE and IE. The cation migration is restrained along the graphene defects, leading to the formation of CFs with different morphologies. Concentrated graphene defects induce the formation of robust CFs with better stability/retention property at a localized region, while the discrete atomic-scale graphene defects enable the formation of discrete tiny CFs with easily spontaneous disruption. This proposed strategy will instruct the implementation of fast TS selectors with high on-state current (≈mA magnitude) and low power dissipation RS memory devices (≈µA magnitude operating current) with enhanced CF stability/retention property by breaking the current-retention dilemma in RS device. In addition, this general method for various cation-based RS devices not only paves the way for ultimate high-density 3D 1S1R integration application of RS memory. Furthermore, the concept of blocking ion migration/diffusion by 2D materials can also arouse new research ideas in ion batteries, ion sensors, and so on.",73,
110,"In summary, we have investigated the resistive switching (RS) memory characteristics of sputtered deposited (Ag,  W)/SiCN/Pt devices. The RS properties of both devices were  significantly related to the number of conduction paths  formed with applied voltage. The W/SiCN/Pt device shows  two-state RS characteristics, whereas the Ag/SiCN/Pt device  exhibits tri-state RS behavior. The tri-state RS behavior of  Ag/SiCN/Pt was ascribed to the additional Ag metallic fila-  ment between the top and bottom electrodes. The temperature and cell area dependent resistance measurement also  confirms the formation of the Ag metallic filament. The con-  duction mechanism analysis revealed an Ohmic conduction  in the low resistance state (LRS) and modified space charge  limited conduction (SCLC) in high resistance state (HRS)  for both devices. In terms of reliability, the Ag/SiCN/Pt  device exhibits excellent data retention (10 s at 200 °C) and  pulse-switching endurance (105 cycles). These results dem-  onstrate the feasibility of the Ag/SiCN/Pt device for futuristic nonvolatile multi-bit storage ReRAM application at high  temperature.",0,
111,"This work addressed the electronic properties of Ta2O5 layers sputtered on STO crystals with high oxygen content. These structures exhibit rectifying diode behavior. XPS analysis revealed a conduction band offset of 1.3 eV, functioning as a barrier for electrons emitted from STO to Ta2O5. The positive voltage currents are modeled by the TAT mechanism. Using the TAT model proposed by Yu et al., we were able to capture the physical parameters of conduction, using the barrier acquired by XPS and including temperature dependence. The results are discussed within the context of the pre-forming Ta2O5 memristor, and the comparison to published data suggest that our observations apply to other works. We note that with devices featuring lower barriers than that reported here for Ta2O5/STO, thermionic emission is expected to play a more important role.",-1,
112,"In conclusion, the Cu/MoS2/Ni-Mn-In device was fabricated using the D.C. sputtering technique for non-volatile resistive switching memory applications. The Cu/MoS2/Ni-Mn-In device shows bipolar resistive switching behavior with an On/OFF resistance ratio of 366, endurance of 500, and retention of 103 s. The device shows ohmic conduction behavior in LRS due to metallic filament formation while space charge limited current (SCLC) is the dominating conduction mechanism in the HRS region. The resistive switching behavior of the fabricated device is well explained by the formation/rupture of the Cu filament across the MIM structure. The introduction of Ni-Mn-In alloys as a bottom electrode provides the opportunity to tune the MoS2 resistive switching characteristics by the temperature parameters because the strain generated during martensite transformation affects the copper filament present in the MoS2 active layer. These results demonstrate the potential of the Cu/MoS2/Ni-Mn- In device for futuristic tunable non-volatile memory device applications.",9,
113,"In summary, the proposed Ag-doped HfOx-based selector devices exhibited bidirectional symmetric threshold switching behavior, with excellent performance characterized by high selectivity (∼105), ultralow OFF current (∼10 pA), steep turnon slope (∼2 mV/decade), and short delay time (3 μs) through the low-temperature hydrogen annealing process. In particular, we produced the filaments required for threshold switching by simply inserting the active metal (Ag) into thin dielectric films such as HfOx rather than using active metal (Ag) electrodes required for the conventional ECM-based selector devices. The operation of devices without annealing exhibited was unstable, owing to the sporadic dispersion of Ag clusters. However, the stability of the device operation was improved significantly by optimizing the annealing temperature (optimal temperature: 200 °C), which allowed Ag-cluster localization of the filament path position, while preserving the via-hole structure. In addition, we found that the growth rate of filaments produced by Ag cations could be increased by reducing the number of oxygen vacancies in hydrogen gas environments. These results suggest that the proposed Pt/Agdoped HfOx/Pt-based selector is a promising candidate for the realization of 3D crossbar RRAM arrays.",-1,
114,"In summary, a novel two-terminal ZnO NRs-based, forming-free memristor has been successfully constructed by utilizing a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure. The ZnO NRs were surface-annealed under hydrogen atmosphere. A thin layer with high concentration of oxygen vacancies was introduced. The thin layer can serve as oxygen vacancies reservoir, consequently large hysteresis loop can been obtained. The Ron/Roff ratio raised from ~10 to 104 with annealing, which exhibited characteristic of nonvolatile-type memory. The charge transport behavior was in good agreement with a classical trap-controlled SCLC. Arrhenius theory was applied to explain the existence of threshold voltage which directly reflected the activation energy. The character of time cumulation in resistance transforming was put forward, which matched up with the definition of memristor. And it was confirmed by simply changing the sweep speed into fast sweep speed mode, which indicated that Arrhenius theory tallied with resistive switching character. Strategies for performance enhancement and theoretical model proposed here may throw light on its practically application in memory devices.",45,
115,"In summary, real-time observations of the CF formation and dissolution processes in ZrO2 -electrotlye-based ReRAM devices were conducted using in situ TEM. The observed phenomena are different from the predictive model based on the electrochemical metallization theory. A modified microscopic mechanism based on the local redox reaction inside the ZrO2 -electrolyte system was suggested to account for observed RS effect. The methodology reported in the present work can be used to investigate the real-time nanostructure evolution process of ReRAM systems at atomic resolutions and lead to a more complete understanding of the underlying nature of the RS behavior, which may serve as a guide to improve the performances and reliability of ReRAM. Although the work was carried out using Ag(or Cu)/ZrO2/Pt structures, the experimental method can be easily extended to other RS materials systems and further promote the rapid development in universal nonvolatile memory system.",24,
116,"We investigated resistive switching characteristics and  temperature dependence of the resistance of the Ni=HfOx=  Pt device. The Ni=HfOx=Pt device indicated a bipolar  operation mode. From the oxide thickness dependence of  switching voltage, it is strongly suggested that the formation  and rupture of CF did not occur in a local region but in the  entire ﬁlament  in the Ni=HfOx=Pt device during the switching  process, if the thickness of the HfOx layer was suﬃciently  smaller than the limitation of the diﬀusion distance of Ni ion  in the oxide  layer.

By controlling different compliance currents and RESET-stop voltages, we are able to demonstrate controllable multistate resistances at LRS and HRS in the ZnO thin film MIM structure under homogeneous resistive switching. Our method could open up an opportunity to explore not only the resistive switch mechanism but also develop next generation multistate high performance memory.",21,
118,"We formed a 30 nm thick BiTiO ﬁlm by ECR sputtering, and  studied the temperature dependence of resistance in the LRS  and HRS. The resistance in the LRS decreased with  increasing temperature, and remained approximately constant  regardless of the electrode-pad area. On the other hand, the  resistance in the HRS increased with temperature, and  showed the pad area dependence. From the cross-sectional HRTEM images, nanocrystalline Bi4Ti3O12 particles were  uniformly distributed in the BiTiO ﬁlm. We proposed a  mechanism of reversible resistance switching, that is, the  ﬁlamentary conduction path is generated along the grain  boundaries of the nanocrystalline particles by electroforming,  and it switches to the LRS. When the ﬁlament is cut off under  an applied bias voltage, switching to the HRS. The conduc-  tion of three-dimensional VRH was obtained in the HRS at  temperatures between 100 and 300 K.",14,
119,"In summary, graphene/diamond (carbon sp^2-sp^3) heterojunctions were demonstrated as photo-controllable memristors. The change in conductivity between the higher and lower resistance states of the junctions was quite large, above 10^3 at ~200 °C, and the junctions have wavelength selectivity to blue or violet light. The mechanism for the change in photoconductivity was considered to be caused by oxidation-reduction of the graphene and/or graphenediamond interfaces through the movement of oxygen ions under bias with photo-irradiation. These results indicate the graphene-diamond, carbon sp^2-sp^3 heterojunctions can be used as high-sensitivity photo-controllable devices with both photomemory and photoswitching functions.",-1,
120,"In conclusion, we have induces bipolar resistive memory switching in Schottky contacts to Mn-doped ZnO films. Switching the system in the low resistance state is equivalent to deplete the space-charge region of the diode of oxygen vacancies, which are the dominant carriers. Since ferromagnetism in this compound is carrier-mediated, a non-volatile switching of the resistive state coexists with a non-volatile switching of the magnetic moment in the depletion layer of the diode.",21,
121,"In summary, we demonstrated high uniformity and large on/off  ratios for a RRAM based on an Al/GO-Au NP/ITO structure. The AuNPs introduced charge-trapping  centers  in the GO ﬁlm,  resulting  in improved RS performance. The devices exhibited a stable endurance  of 100 cycles and a retention over 10^4 s at 85 °C, giving them strong  potential for non-volatile memory applications. Further, multilevel RS  behavior was achieved by tuning the CC and Vstop. Raman spectroscopy and C-AFM revealed that RS is due to the migration of oxygen  functional groups in the GO layer, leading to the formation of CFs.  Moreover, the multilevel RRAM displayed excellent analog RS behav-  ior. Finally, we demonstrated image pattern recognition using a digital  memristor based on STDP learning rules. These results show that our  RRAM device is a promising candidate for ANNs and provide a feasi-  ble approach for the realization of carbon-based artiﬁcial synapse  devices.",3,

124,"A signature of multiple CFs was identiﬁed by investigating the eﬀect of the WN layer thickness dependence of the RS behavior of the TaOx-based devices fabricated on the wafer with the pillar structure.The systematic analysis revealed the formation of multiple CFs  and the metallic  nature of CFs  in the present device.Even though this study cannot be generalized easily to all other ﬁlamentary-type RS memories because the situations vary for many parameters such as device materials and experimental conditions, it can provide a simple method to identify the ﬁlament formation behavior under appropriate conditions.",-1,
125,"In conclusion, unlike traditional CRS RRAM devices which combine two discrete devices in a back-to-back structure, we utilized a SiOx layer inserted into the resistive switching layer to realize single cell CRS switching. Owing to the intrinsic electrical properties of low k material, we could modify the SiOx film breakdown degree and the oxygen storage capacity by changing forming compliance current. The RRAM device switching behavior was transformed from standard bipolar switching to CRS. Low-k material insertion technology, especially IC fabrication-compatible SiOx layer insertion is an efficient way to modify RRAM device switching behaviors, which poses a promising technology for the CRS RRAM applications.",30,
126,"In conclusion, we found that nonvolatile, polaritydependent resistance switching is observed universally in various transition-metal-oxide thin films. This result suggests that the resistance switching is irrelevant to the detailed electronic structure of each sample, but is dominated by a general origin, like crystalline defect.",14,
127,"In conclusion, RRAM is an emerging technology that has  plenty of opportunities to enable useful nonvolatile memory  devices in the near future. The attractive defect-physics is  very suitable to improve the performance of ECM, VCM, and  molecular RRAM devices. Defect engineering can be done in  several ways such as doping of the oxide layer, nanocrystal-based  switching layer design, embedded metals in switching oxide, and defective electrode design. Defects in RRAM can play an important  role in several ways such as improving the localization of the elec-  tric field, increasing the charge trapping ability, and also it can  serve for different purposes based on the structure design.",6,
128,"Defect engineering can be influenced by the material, size,  shape, and configuration. Moreover,  it is  difficult  to control  defect distribution from device to device. For example, although the  cycle-to-cycle switching reliability for a single NC-based RRAM  device can improve, the device-to-device variation of NCs’ size,  shape, and density can lead to device-level fluctuations of resistive  switching parameters. Scalability  is  one of  the major advantages of RRAM, which has a potential to hit the atomic level. Hence, con-  trolling the size of NCs in such an atomic scale is another vital  challenge. In the sandwich form, it can improve the performance;  however, realization of the physics behind the switching process of  such devices is complicated.",6,
129,"One of the major advantages of defect engineering of RRAM  devices is the improvement of the localized electric field, which is  also possible with a nanostructure electrode design. As the device  size of RRAM is scaled down to several nanometer ranges, controlling  the size and shape of  the nanostructure electrode  is  very critical. However, depending on the requirements and applications,  defects in the RRAM devices can be engineered. In a controlled  manner, defects are tremendous possibilities for memory and neuro- morphic  applications,   as  they   can  provide   stable   and controlled switching. In an uncontrolled way, defects are essential to introduce  randomness and entropy change during switching and are useful for  hardware security applications.",6,
130,"The calculated results show that the V_O levels appear in the band gap. The formation of defect bands in the band gap can be speculated on if the V_O density becomes high enough to interact with each other. Thus, the V_O is a possible origin of the current conduction paths in the ReRAM, in addition to metallic Al defects pointed out experimentally.",31,
131,"Finally, we propose an atomistic mechanism of the resistive switching assuming high a V_O density. When V_Os are in filled states by electron injection, Al atoms become close and then a metallic band appears in the band gap. When V_Os are in empty states by electron ejection, Al atoms move away from the V_O with large energy level shifts toward the bulk conduction band edge (i.e., the vacancy character is suppressed); thus, disconnections of the mid-gap electronic conduction paths occur. Former and later correspond to low and high resistance states, respectively. The V_O formation/ annihilation by O migrations reported previously for transition-metal oxides is also a candidate mechanism in amorphous alumina. If the presented mechanism is the dominant cause of the resistive switching, an amorphous seems to be more suitable for a ReRAM material than crystals, because the energy levels and atomic structures associated with V_O are more sensitive to its charge states.",31,
132,"By combining an ultrathin Ta buffer layer, a Ti scavenging layer and PDA, we succeeded in reducing the HfO2 layer more effectively while retaining the optimum combination of the Ta electrode and the HfO2 layer. These results indicate that the RS behavior can be improved by controlling the structure in the vicinity of the oxygen and metal electrode interface. We believe that this method is applicable to the lowering and control of the forming voltage and operating current of ReRAM.",1,
133,"In conclusion, a method in which ALD, adhesive tape, and chemical etching are combined, is demonstrated here for mass production of nanogap electrodes arrays with gap width predetermined by the thickness of ALD-deposited Al 2 O 3 with sub-nanometer resolution. A unipolar nonvolatile resistive switching behavior was identifi ed in the obtained nanogap electrodes, showing stable, robust performance and the ability of multibit storage, demonstrating great potential in ultrahighdensity storage. The formation and dissolution of Si CFs and migration of Au atoms is the mechanism behind the resistive switching.",41,
134,"IIn summary, APCMO films that are grown on ITO/glass substrates are n-type materials and exhibit good transparency  in the visible ranges. The Pt/APCMO/ITO device showed  typical bipolar resistive switching properties with reliable  retention behavior at RT and stable resistive switching prop-  erties, indicating that it could be applied to nonvolatile mem-  ory devices. The resistive switching behavior of the APCMO  film is related to the trap-charged SCLC mechanism, because  the current depends linearly on the voltage at low voltages  and then on the square of the voltage at higher voltages. The  presence of oxygen vacancies in the APCMO film reduces  the potential barrier of the Pt/APCMO interface, leading to  the device being in the LRS. On the other hand, a reduction  in the number of oxygen changes the device from LRS to  HRS by increasing the barrier height of the Pt/APCMO inter-  face. Therefore, the role of oxygen vacancies is important for  the bipolar switching behavior of the Pt/APCMO/ITO device.",27,
135,"We have attempted to reduce variation of the switching voltage using APA prepared by various anodic conditions. The oxalic samples had very poor endurance and the expected effect was not seen. Meanwhile, the devices prepared by sulfuric acid showed typical switching behaviors with good endurance. Especially, 60 s anodic sample had nice RMM of 1.9 and 2.1 for SET and RESET voltages, respectively. The AET sample indicated the same RMM as the sample with 60 s anodizaiton but the endurance was improved by this additional electrochemical treatment.",25,
136,"In summary, we have investigated the scalability and reliability issues of Ti/HfOx-based 1T1R bipolar RRAM, which is caused by the interaction between the memory cell and transistor during the FORMING process. Owing to the significant increase of FORMING current during the FORMING process of the memory cell at higher VDS of the transistor, the activation of self-CRS can impede the scaling and performance of the Ti/HfOx-based 1T1R bipolar RRAM. Besides, a sufficiently lower FORMING voltage can mitigate the RP issue occurring in Ti/HfOx-based bipolar RRAM. Moreover, an alternative Ta buffer layer over HfOx dielectrics is also proposed, which can heal the RP effect by suppressing the generation of self-CRS during the FORMING process, showing feasibility towards solving scalability and reliability issues of HfOx-based 1T1R bipolar RRAM technology.",30,
137,"In conclusion, the effects of adding external series resistance, the use of bulk device architecture, and the backward-scan effect were investigated in SiOx-based ReRAM.Reset voltage in a 1T-1R configuration is larger than in a 1R structure, and approaches the set voltage as series resistance is reduced.Non-edge, bulk SiOx-based devices fabricated using a lift-off process provide further insight into resistive switching mechanisms and show improved device performance by hydrogen or deuterium incorporation, although some degradation of resistance ratio was observed in the bulk device as compared to edge devices.Moreover, the backward-scan effect was examined in detail by controlling the falling time of AC pulses, where it was found that reset voltage falling times longer than 1 ls can result in the inability to reset the device to a HRS.Circuit-level simulations using a Verilog-A behavioral model were used to investigate device-programming strategies for future nonvolatile memory applications.",0,
138,"The NPs assembly structure of Pt/c-Fe2O3-NPs/Pt exhibited the analog memristive switching depending on the polarity of applied voltage. The resistance was sequentially decreased as repeating V sweeps and pulses while increased as repeating +V. The C–V curves presented the hysteresis with flatband voltage shift and distortion of their shapes with respect to the applied voltage, verifying the redistribution of space charges in NPs assembly as a possible way to induce resistive switching. The repeating pulse of 5/+5 and 7/+5 V led to gradual and repeatable resistance change. Also, increasing pulse voltage and width resulted in increased resistance change. These results of polarity dependent analog switching are distinguishable from the digital-type unipolar and bipolar switching shown typically in thin film structures. These analog memristive switching characteristics have a potential to be applied to the neuromorphic devices by emulating synaptic motion.",26,
139,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated the switchable diode effect in the epitaxial BFO thin films. By analyzing the work function of the materials, schematic energy band diagrams are set up to illustrate the variations in Schottky-like barriers from virgin state to electrically polarized up and polarized down states. The origin of the switchable diode effect is attributed to the modulation of Schottky-like barriers, which might be related to ferroelectric polarization, oxygen vacancies, electrode materials, etc.",4,
140,"In summary, a facile and universal method based on hydrothermal techniques was developed to fabricate h-BN-C QDTS. To avoid strong and violent alkali metal and high temperature, KNa-tartrate was utilized as an intercalant and the substitution of carbon atom in h-BN matrix to get h-BN-C QDTs. As-prepared h-BN-C QDTs exhibited a 10 times higher photoluminescence characteristics and a blue shift when compare to quantum dots prepared without the treatment of KNa-tartrate. Further, due to higher carbon content, h-BN-C QDTs showed lower value of band gap energy. Next, the h-BN-C QDTs were utilized as a dielectric active layer for non-volatile resistive switching memory devices. The mechanism
of fabricated bipolar resistive switching memory device was deduced to be space-charged limited current (SCLC) model due to the sp2 character of C-bond in h-BN-C QDTs. These results indicates the decisive role of defects in h-BN 2 D nanomaterials and it can advance emerging applications on thin film flexible memory devices.",-1,

Adding the three main costs, the total cost of the SFCL will be around 320,000$ per-phase.",75,
142,"With this cost, the substation is going to be able to break the maximum expected SC current after the power from GERD dam is integrated to the substation with around thirty percent safety margin. This means the substation can integrate another 5976 MVA SC rating (depend on lines and generator impedance; it can reach up 3000mw power generation).",75,

145,"In conclusion, we fabricated a single asperity Pt NGJ whose thickness was about 5 nm by the EB lithography with a bilayer resist, and investigated the electrical characteristics. The NGJ having a single-asperity tunneling junction showed  the NDR characteristic the resistive switching effects, which had only been reported for the devices with multiple tunneling junctions. AFM observations before and after the current sweep showed that the gap distance was narrowed after the current sweep. The tunneling area and the gap distance for on/off-state were quantitatively estimated by the fitting the  measured characteristics to the simple model as 100 nm2  and 0.8/1.2 nm, respectively. The resistance ratio differing by  more than two orders of magnitude was measured routinely.  However, the details of the structural change in the gap with  the resistive switching have not been clarified yet. We consider that AFM observations before and after the operation of NGJ as a memory device might give us any insight on the operating mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the resistive switching effect occurs at the very ends of narrow  electrode pairs, therefore, the NGJ is suitable for further miniaturization and it is a promising candidate for a building  block of the future nonvolatile memory systems.",-1,
146,"In summary, we have demonstrated concurrent resistance and capacitance switching in Pt/LaAlO3 /Nb:SrTiO3 devices which show good data retention and endurance. Both the modification of Schottky-like Pt/LaAlO3 interface and the formation of conducting filaments contribute to the switching effects. Our results also suggest that the generation and migration of oxygen vacancies can be controlled by the growth conditions and the electrode selection, which is critical for achieving reliable device performance.",2,

A large on/off ratio greater than two orders of magnitude and stable retention characteristics for more than 104 s at 85 °C were obtained in the MLG/PCMO/Pt device. Our device exhibited typical interfacial-reaction-type RRAM behavior; no forming process was required and both HRS and LRS changed with device size. Moreover, Raman spectra obtained in HRS revealed sudden increases in D and D_x0002_ peaks and a large shift in G band peak to a higher frequency as compared to those in LRS. These results indicate that resistive switching is attributable to formation and dissolution of an oxygenated graphene layer at the MLG/PCMO interface.",32,

149,"In conclusion, the switching uniformity of the AZO/ ZnO1x/ITO transparent RRAM can be improved by employing a double forming process. Single forming process establishes multiple filaments that participate in the set/reset process, thereby deteriorating HRS and LRS stability. However, the double forming process may limit the number and size of filaments; consequently, random variations of the participating filaments can be controlled in the set/reset process, enabling uniform switching with a high HRS/LRS ratio to be attained. Furthermore, reasonable switching cycles of more than 450 cycles with an ON/OFF ratio of 102 and satisfactory retention of up to 104 s confirms the reliability of devices after double forming process. In addition to that, highly transparent memory devices have been fabricated. This study not only offers a promising candidate for future transparent electronic applications but also suggests a simple solution for preventing data read errors in RRAMs.",-1,
150,"We have successfully prepared a TQ-based D−A N-heteroacene Py-1-TQ and its two counterparts of Py-0-TQ and Py-2-TQ. Compared with Py-0-TQ and Py-2-TQ, Py-1-TQ contains one type of donor (decyloxyl) and two different types of acceptors (pyrazine and TQ) sequentially-fused in one row, which can trigger stepwise charge transfer processes. All three molecules exhibit distinct self-assembly behaviors and optoelectronic properties. Although Py-0-TQ and Py-2-TQ based memory devices show FLASH-type binary memory behaviors, Py-1-TQ displays excellent WORM-type ternary memory effects, which hold a great potential to realize the UHDDS application. Our results illustrate the potential of TQ-based N-heteroacenes as promising high-density data-storage candidates, and open up many new possibilities to prepare high-performance D−A N-heteroacene systems through rational molecular design.",60,
151,"Thus, an oxidized NSTO/LSMCO interface leads to a RLOW (CHIGH) state, and a reduced interface results in a RHIGH (CLOW) state. The key factor for this behavior is the topotactic redox ability of LSMCO, which tolerates large changes in its oxygen content between oxidized and reduced phases. The physical origin of the large memcapacitance is intriguing and can be attributed to different effects. A possible one is related to large variations in the donor/acceptor balance at the NSTO/LSMCO interface upon LSMCO redox. The p-character of oxidized LSMCO is determined by the 0.5 holes/f.u. introduced in the lattice when Sr2þ ions replace La3þ. In the reduced phase, each OV leaves two electrons behind, and part of these electrons will recombine with existing holes, reducing the number of uncompensated LSMCO acceptors. This could strongly change the (NSTO) donor/(LSMCO) acceptor balance at the interface, affecting the diode depletion layer and its capacitance. Other possible origin for the large memcapacitance is the Maxwell-Wagner effect, related to the creation of metallic zones embedded in the dielectric oxide, acting as the parallel plates of nanocapacitors,43 that could produce large effective dielectric constants. 44 The metallization of the NSTO/LSMCO interface in the RLOW (CHIGH) state could take place inhomogeneously, generating an interfacial capacitance significantly larger than that expected for a homogeneous interface. Further studies are necessary to confirm and get deeper insight into these mechanisms, together with the development of strategies to circumvent the electroforming process.",72,
152,"In conclusion, we introduced a three-terminal ReRAM device in which the state of the memory device can be modulated via the application of a voltage on the third, gating electrode. Non-volatile states can be effectively set in the device by using different gate voltages, offering an extra control parameter for ReRAMs, in addition to the top-bottom controlling electrodes found in conventional two- terminal devices. Our solid-state device can become a tool for programmable logics or for simulation of complex neuronal operations. The device is formed of all-oxide transparent components, offering this system to advanced future applications in transparent electronics products.",33,
153,"Although ANNs have been inspired by the biological nervous system, it should be pointed out that the gap between them is still very large. Table 2 briefly summarizes the research status of biological and artificial neural systems to illustrate the details. A few examples are briefly discussed below.",13,
154,"In biological system, there is a large variety of neurons that collaboratively function. The most important division is the division into excitatory and inhibitory neurons, while in current ANNs neurons send out mixed excitatory and inhibitory types of synapses. This division allows for further functional specialization of those neurons. Currently, a great concerted international effort is underway to create a catalog of all cell types in the nervous system.[297] We estimate there are hundreds of different types of neurons. For the retina and cerebral cortex, a complete cell census appears within reach. Some of those types are present at different parts of brain, but even at the level of a local circuit in the cerebral cortex, there are at least four types of inhibitory neurons which are well studied and the final number will probably be in the tens. For each type of neuron, there is a set of morphological, physiological, molecular and connectional properties associated, which might dictate different computational and plasticity rules. Elucidating how this diversity contributes to computational function and delineating the detailed role of each type of neuron will occupy much of the effort of neuroscientist in the coming years. Examples of different types of neurons are illustrated in Figure 13. In a hardware composed of electronic devices, however, there are usually limited types of devices with unique function(s) for each type. How to model this diversity on the neuronal level in electronic devices will be one of the big challenges in the future.[297]",13,
155,Some of the diversities that we think are of particular importance will be discussed in more details below.,33,
156,"Divided by the type of responses it produces in the downstream neuron upon firing, there are two types of neurons in the nervous system, excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The excitatory neurons are considered to be information coding and carry information across different parts of the brain. The inhibitory neurons are usually local interneurons, although they can also be long range projecting neurons in other parts of the brain. This makes it possible for the inhibitory neurons to perform specialized computations. As explained under the previous section, the electrical properties and plasticity rules associated with the inhibitory neurons are often quite different from the excitatory neurons, which would not be possible if a single type of neurons send out mixed excitatory and inhibitory synapses as in current ANNs.",13,
157,"Some of the currently known functions performed by inhibitory neurons include the following:[298] First, the inhibitory neurons can mediate lateral competition and winnertake- all type of operations, which can be useful in generating sparse codes and solve constraint-satisfaction problems.[299,300] Second, brain uses sophisticated mechanisms to maintain the total amount of excitation and inhibition in the circuit to be roughly the same. Besides ensuring stability and giving robustness to the system, circuits maintained in this approximate balance can give fast responses to incoming stimuli. Third, inhibitory neurons act as gates to control aspects of local processing and ensure spatiotemporal coordination, often mediated by different kinds of interneurons, such as output gates (chandelier neurons), input gates (somatostain neurons), and plasticity gates (VIP neurons). This divides the local circuit into different computing subroutines that can be called upon at different times. Fourth, interneuron system can act as a distributed clock. The brain has numerous rhythms spanning the time epochs from tens of seconds to milliseconds, which can be set up by negative feedback loops using inhibitory neurons. These local clocks can also synchronize with each other giving rise to sophisticated communication schemes. How to model those aspects of the neuronal circuits would be an interesting challenge for the neuromorphic engineering community. It is worth mentioning that there are recently some interesting studies on neuromorphic computing based on device synchronization.[301,302]",13,
158,"Recently, there is growing research interest driven by recent technological advances to the capability of dendrites in single neuron in computing.[303] Recent work show that neuronal dendrites exhibit a range of nonlinear mechanisms that allow them to implement complex computations beyond that of simple summation in perceptron neurons (Figure 14a).[304,305] For example, a single neuron can carry out computations that are similar to a network of two-layer perceptron (palimpsest neuron, Figure 14c) or even more sophisticated operations such multiplication of two sets of inputs (complex neurons, Figure 14d). Emerging neuromorphic devices, e.g., RRAM, have been used to emulate the dendritic computation,[306] which could be a potential approach to improve computation ability for future highvolume computing tasks.",13,
159,"The brain uses spikes to communicate. This gives the opportunity to use complex spatiotemporal codes and coordination schemes for computation, and there are recently several implementations based on RRAM.[42,307] As mentioned above, the synchronization of the firing times can be used as distributed clocks to temporarily bind several items together for processing. Besides, the brain activities rely greatly on historical events while ANNs emphasize more on the current input. The brain is constantly performing predictions into the future which might underlie some of its advanced intelligence.",13,
160,"One of the largest gaps is that the brain uses a sophisticated control to regulate the flow of information and plasticity. There are also dedicated areas such as thalamus that serve as gate and hub for information flow. Such modulation can be realized through neuromodulators released more diffusely or specialized circuits using inhibitory neurons or specialized compartments on the dendrites (Section 5.2.3). Together with the distributed clocking system mentioned above, the brain can be set up to have a different network configuration for different tasks whenever needed. This is somewhat similar to the mixture-of-experts network in current artificial neural network literature but in a much more sophisticated manner.[268,308]",13,
161,"Although deep learning has made big strides in recent years, the automatic learning ability of biological systems is still unrivaled in robustness and flexibility. Several researchers have voiced criticisms of deep learning in recent years on those grounds.[309]",13,
162,"Recent advances in neuroscience techniques have allowed us to observe and manipulate a population of neurons encoding a memory engram, the engram cells.[248] This brings the investigation of learning and memory to the cell population and circuitry level. Such memory might not be formed arbitrarily from a tabula rasa as typically done in computer memories, but might be highly regulated and organized according to innate principles.[310] How such rules relate to the diversity of cell types also remain to be investigated. Progress is currently rapid in this field. This aspect has rarely been emulated using neuromorphic devices yet. There seems a possibility that by using nonvolatile electronic devices, the storage and retrieve function of memory can be realized.",39,
163,"Current deep learning algorithms achieve success by learning form big volume of labeled data. But the biological nervous system is able to learn from a few examples and continue to learn without explicit instructions automatically while performing functions throughout the life span, not just at specialized times (Sections 4.2.3 and 5.3.5). How to close this gap is a currently very active area in artificial intelligence. Researchers in the neuromorphic computing field are also starting to tackle these problems and much progress is expected in this area.",13,
164,"In summary, there are still many inevitable challenges in materials and devices to implement bio-realistic neural systems. A great diversity of neuronal and synaptic types and subtypes exists in biological system, as well as the complexity of plasticity or learning rules (including modulation). Such diversity originates from different ways to assemble many parts (e.g., protein molecules and complexes) selected in evolution, and may be critical for the robustness and other properties of biological systems. Implementing similar diversity in electronic systems with current technology will be a daunting task. Yet, it could be worthwhile to implement certain aspects of it, and to explore how critical these aspects are for the proper functionalities of biological and artificial systems.",39,
165,"In summary, we have theoretically investigated the atomic and electronic role the Al2O3 VO barrier layer in advanced ReRAM stacks based on first-principles calculations. Our results showed that VO filament formation in Al2O3 can be controlled by applying voltages, which leads to the ON–OFF switching of ReRAM. This conductive filament formed by cohesion of VOs is composed of extended s- and p-orbital of Al atoms along the VO-chain. Moreover, we pointed out that ReRAM stacks with the Al2O3 VO barrier layer can reveal both bipolar and unipolar characteristics by designing stack structures.",1,
166,"In summary, we present an electro-photo-sensitive memristor that allows incremental and bi-directional conductance change solely by optical excitation. Within a critical voltage range, illumination with different wavelengths leads to increasing and decreasing conductances that are explained by intraband and interband absorption, respectively. The optical memristance control may pave the way to the realization of artificial synapses for sensory applications. Depending on the wavelength of incoming light, the conductance is raised or lowered. Thus, converting information of the light into an electrical signal by sensory neurons is not required, and learning can directly be induced by light.",-1,
167,"In conclusion, we investigated the structural and electrical characteristics of Cu-oxide based RRAM with Al, Pt, and Ti electrodes. High ON/OFF ratio, high stability, and good endurance were demonstrated with Al electrode in contrast to Pt and Ti samples. It was suggested that this great improvement was achieved by controlling the movement of oxygen at the interface with AlOx interface layer. Oxygen ion loss in Pt and Ti electrode causes degradation of the switching performance.",11,
168,"In summary, we have realized proton-based memory resistors with multilevel states in epitaxial NNO heterostructure devices by designing the asymmetry of proton concentration. Due to the extreme sensitivity of NNO resistivity to proton, switching occurs near the hydrogenated interface, and the extent of resistance modulation in our protonic devices can be controlled by adjusting the magnitude of the external bias. Exploitation of resistive switching by proton migration in correlated oxides provides a strategy to design energy-efficient electronic devices by overcoming the fundamental bottleneck conventional resistive switching devices, and provides an important step toward the development of correlated electronics, such as two-terminal neuromorphic devices.",-1,
169,"In conclusion, three different RS regimes are demonstrated to coexist in a single TaOx based memristor. By controlling the current compliances in the Set process or the stop voltages in the Reset process, the switching mode can be selected or exchanged among the three RS regimes in the single TaOx memristor. The conduction mechanisms have been revealed in the a-TaOx memristor by analyzing the electrical properties of the three RS regimes combined with the simulation of the QPC model, which reveals the evolution of the CF during Set and Reset transitions. Around the quantum conductance G0 or less than G0, a substantial RS instability and noise enhancement exist in the TaOx device, which degrades the endurance performance of the medium and high RS regimes. The instability and noise are likely caused by thermal fluctuations in the quantum point contact of a conducting channel, revealing the thermally activated and stochastic nature of the RS in a-TaOx memristors. The results shed light on the characteristics and transport mechanisms of multiple resistance levels or analog behavior of TaOx memristors, which are crucial for multilevel-cell (MLC) memory and neuromorphic computing applications. Eventually, the methodology reported in this work can be easily extended to exploit the transport mechanism and the evolution of a CF between the ON-state and the OFF-state in other memristor devices. ",26,
170,"In summary, we successfully designed and fabricated a novel hybrid optical/electric memristor, which uses light and voltage as inputs. The simple device fabrication is compatible with scalable deposition techniques and yields a robust and flexible device. A memristive behavior is demonstrated whose operation can be controlled by light illumination, enabling self-powered operation and hybrid optical/electric logic. Exploiting a continuously tunable dependence of set voltage and light intensity, a novel device is realized that permits multilevel logic and storage as well as time-delayed switching. These novel properties can be applied toward lithography-free light-based communication devices for the realization of distributed sensing and IoT.",53,

All the manganese oxide thin films developed in this study exhibited transparent properties. The fabricated manganese oxide RRAM device exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region and reliable resistance switching properties such as low switching voltage, better retention, and switching cycling. In addition, the non-CTA treated and CTA-treated thin films exhibited ohmic conduction with metal-like behavior for low applied voltages. Furthermore, fewer oxygen defects and vacancies in the CTA-treated manganese oxide thin films of the RRAM devices were found. From these results, the manganese oxide thin films are judged to be an excellent candidate for the fabrication of RRAM devices or other devices to be applied to system on panel (SOP) structures.",16,
172,"RS has been reported to be closely related to the formation and rupture of conducting track (a fractal shape known as filament). Although the exact nature of the filament in TiO2 is not yet clear, the migration of oxygen vacancies (Vo2+) in the vicinity of the interface under applied voltage is suggested to drive RS. Thus, introduction of Co in TiO2−δ film at diluted concentration provides a controllable way of manipulating the oxygen vacancies via its need to satisfy its valance Co2+_x0002_, as well as its contribution to scattering which can enhance the HRS value.",34,

On the basis of the redistribution of oxygen vacancies in the resistive switching layer, we employed a behavioral model that reproduced the I–V characteristics of the FeOx-based memristor very well. By applying consecutive voltage pulses, the device was successfully demonstrated to mimic the history-dependent analog tuning of biological synapses, including potentiation and depression. In addition, the tuning rate can be modulated by changing the duration and amplitude of the pulses. The FeOx-based memristor demonstrated in this work could be expected to be used as the basic building block for future artificial neural networks and neuromorphic computations.",3,
175,"In summary, we have reported a low-power unipolar Ni/HfO2 /Si RRAM with unique evolution on VSET, VRESET, RLRS, RHRS, and IRESET across a very wide range. Chargedissipation current proportional to the powers of VSET was found playing an important role in the filament morphology and thus the corresponding IRESET and PRESET. Both the reduction on IRESET and on the ratio between RHRS and RLRS may be explained by the formation of inactive semiconductive filaments at nanoscale. The thorough understanding on the evolution of filament morphology may facilitate further power and current scaling in the high-density unipolar RRAM.",-1,
176,"In summary, a designable photonic memristive effect was observed in SRRs based metamaterials with MgTiO3 ceramic substrate. The photonic memristive switching behavior is caused by the increase in permittivity of MgTiO3 ceramic which is resulted from the increasing temperature generated by the combination of electromagnetic field-driven Joule heating and heat dissipation. When the sample is encapsulated by materials with low thermal conductivity and vacuum, ideal photonic memristor would be obtained. This mechanism might open up new opportunities for realizing transient photonic memristor.",-1,
177,"In summary, the switching properties of PCMO sandwiched by noble metal electrode are essentially affected by the geometric design of the electrodes. A combination of a small-sized electrode with an extended counter electrode favors a single-interface switching at the small-sized interface as long as the current density is not too high. In devices with similar interface areas, both interfaces contribute to the resistance change above a threshold current density or voltage, however, in an opposing manner. This allows an inversion of the switching polarity simply by changing the dimensions of the respective electrodes. We found a clear tendency that the dominant contribution to the resistance change stems from that interface, which reveals a low interfacial resistance. A pronounced single-interface switching takes place if the electrode is made from metals with high work functions (and good interface quality), giving rise to a switching capability, which increases in the order of Ag < Au < Pt. The trend for preferred switching at the interface with low interfacial resistance supports the idea that a critical current density rather than a critical electric field controls the structural modifications, which leads to the remanent resistance change. Indeed, a current induced structural phase transition related to polaron/charge ordering is regularly observed in in situ TEM experiments at the low resistance electrode formed by the noble metal with high work function.10 Thereby, the high resistance state is formed if the respective electrode is on positive polarity, implying oxygen anion migration toward the interface and formation of an oxygen depleted region within the functional oxide. The detailed mechanisms in the structurally modified layer within the functional oxide, in particular, the interplay of oxygen vacancy induced disorder, change of charge carrier doping, and resulting charge ordering phase transitions, are, at present, not very well understood.",64,
178,"We have performed STEM–EELS analysis of microstructures and Ti valence states in the RS regions of four-terminal TiO2−x single-crystal memristive devices. High-contrast streaks were observed in the cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images taken from the electrocolored region formed by the application of voltage. Analysis on ΔE and Eon of Ti-L2,3 edges EELS spectra revealed that the colored region includes a valence state reflecting further reduced TiO2−x and such a valence state mainly exists within ∼50 nm from the crystal surface. The TiO2−x crystal is locally reduced on the nanometer scale in the vicinity of the surface by the application of voltage and thus a change in resistance is expected to occur near the surface of the present fourterminal memristor device. The information obtained in this study should contribute to a deeper understanding of the RS phenomena and further development of the TiO2−x-based memristive devices.",28,
179,"In conclusion, we have studied the magnetic field direction dependent PHE in a Sr4Ru3O10 nanosheet. A large PHE signal is observed when a swept, in-plane magnetic field is applied. This PHE is found to be sensitive to the direction of the magnetic field, and it shows sharp resistance switching when the field is swept in the I and III quadrants towards the [100] crystal axis. The analysis of the data demonstrates that the magnetic reversal is through a spin-flop process when the field is oriented between [100] and [010] directions but a spin-flip process when the field is oriented between [010] and [100] directions, indicating that there exists a magnetic easy-axis along the [110] direction and a metastable axis along the [110] direction in the Sr4Ru3O10 nanosheet.",-1,
180,"In conclusion, we show that ultrathin few-layer HfS2 can be incorporated into a variety of vdW heterostructures and selectively transformed into an amorphous high-k oxide using laser irradiation. In contrast to sputtering or ALD, the use of photo-oxidized HfS2 allows for clean interfaces without damaging the underlying 2D materials. We demonstrate that the laser-written HfOx has a dielectric constant k ~ 15 and a breakdown field of ~0.5 to 0.6 V/nm. These properties allow us to demonstrate several promising high-quality vdW heterostructure devices using this oxide: (i) ReRAM elements that operate in the voltage limit of ~1 V; (ii) flexible TMDC-FETs with Ion/Ioff > 104 , subthreshold swings of 100 mV per decade, and good resilience to bending cycles; and (iii) optoelectronic devices based on quantum well architectures, which can emit and detect light in the same device, with EL intensities and drive voltages comparable to devices with hBN barriers and photodetection response times up to 106 times faster than equivalent planar MoS2 devices. Moreover, the high-k dielectric constant, the compatibility with 2D materials, and the ease of laser-writing techniques (58) will allow for significant scaling improvements and greater device functionality, which we predict to be an important feature for future flexible semi-transparent vdW nanoelectronics.",1,
181,"Utilization of PANI, predoped with a rather strong acid (DBSA), resulted in the improvement of two important parameters of the polymeric electrochemical device (organic memristor), namely, the conductivity ratio in conducting and insulating states and in the absolute value of the conductivity for the positive polarity of the applied voltage. Due to the presence of the high molecular weight anion, the use of DBSA during the PANI synthesis guarantees the significant decrease in the dedoping rate, which is rather high in the case of HCl doping, resulting in the improvement of the device characteristics and its working time. This result is very important for the successful realization of the adaptive networks based on a large number of such elements. We can expect, in fact, a high signal-to-noise ratio and possibility of effective supervised and unsupervised learning of the system. The increase in the stability of electrical properties’ variation can be obtained by measurements in controlled conditions or by effective sealing of the fabricated structures.",8,
182,"In conclusion, we proposed a new nonvolatile RRAM device having a metal/SiOx/3C-SiC/Si/metal MIS structure with a thin electron-tunneling oxide layer. The electronic behavior was explained in terms of defect states generated probably near the Si oxide/3C-SiC interface region, on the basis of the results of I–V, C–V, and XPS measurements. The C–V results indicated that the states are donor-like states. The on and off resistance change is related to injection/ejection of electrons into/from the states. The defect states were formed with good reproducibility, which may be a result of the oxidation of the binary material system (SiC). We also succeeded in operating the memory function dynamically.",6,
183,"Simultaneous measurements of the electrical characteristics and X-ray fluorescence have allowed us to demonstrate directly that on the microscopic level the mechanism of the electrochemically induced conductivity variation of the organic memristor involves the motion of the metal ions between the active layer of PANI and the solid electrolyte. The memristor conductivity value was found to be directly related to the number of Rb ions in the PANI active zone, measured by the X-ray fluorescence and ionic current in the structure. Even if the realized structure is different from that used in previous studies (gel instead of solid electrolyte, heavier ions), we can claim that the obtained results can be effectively used for the explanation of the properties of solidstate elements. In fact, the temporal characteristics of the reported structure are well comparable to those of previously reported devices (4). This can be due to the fact that the increase of the ion mobility due to the utilization of gel instead of solid electrolyte was compensated for by the decrease of mobility due to the use of a larger ion (Rb instead of Li).",42,
184,"Neuromorphic computing was motivated by beyond Moore’s law and machine learning leading to parallel distributed processing. Memristor based vector matrix multiplication was proposed to satisfy this need. A parallel distributed architecture is also required even in a mobile application for ﬁnetuning when supervised learning is indispensable. However, since the parallel distributed processing makes the chip bulky, it has limited scalability. As a result, making multilevel with a wide synaptic weight bit width is a fundamental breakthrough that overcomes the limit of scaling down. A development guideline of memristor synaptic weight is nonvolatility, linearity, and multilevel.",47,
185,"Resistive memory switching based on bipolar switching and unipolar switching has been found to coexist in the same switching material so that more detailed physical interpretation is necessary for memory switching mechanisms. Analog switching is not limited to threshold switching. Charge trap materials can also be used as an analog switching node.95 It has been used as a ﬂoating gate, but it can be used for neuron and short term memory node. Thus, it is desired to develop new charge trap materials with various detrap rates with corresponding physical interpretation.",0,
186,No perfect memristor based neuron is developed yet except for node such as MIT threshold switching and magnetic tunneling switching while CMOS based memristors have been emulated.

187,"In summary, we report an intriguing, yet straightforward approach to engineer functional properties, namely resistive switching and high-temperature ferromagnetic response, by interstitial light element doping in a novel composite oxide system. A large electronegativity difference between the B and La cations in the host LAO lattices preserves effective interstitial B doping, which is critical for the reconstruction of the electronic states and magnetization of the composite system used in this study. The eventual tunability of the induced effects via the rearrangement of Bi by an external stimulus proves the robustness of the mechanism, and its potential utility in a host of other bulk oxide dielectric materials, which is validated by the result of thin film synthesis. The proposed mechanism, therefore, has a universal character and can be explored with different combinations of heavy and light element cations in ionic compound materials systems. The adopted route predominantly takes impact of the interstitial doping, in contrast to the widely employed substitutional doping. Our findings offer a pathway to engineer a new class of bulk oxide materials with light element interstitial dopants for desirable ionic/electronic and magnetic characteristics in oxide-based electronic and energy applications.",-1,
188,"In summary, we systematically characterized the low temperature switchable diode effect induced resistive switching in the epitaxial BFO films. Combining the analysis of leakage mechanisms at film/electrode interface and the current induced barrier height, the Schottky-like barriers for both positive and negative polarized states are determined. The switchable diode relies on temperature and the ferroelectric switchable diode can be manipulated by both the temperature and ferroelectric polarization.",4,
189,"Horizontally aligned CNTs were grown by chemical vapor deposition on ST-cut quartz (Hoffman Materials) using ferritin (Sigma-Aldrich) as catalyst and CH4 as carbon source. Aligned CNTs grown on quartz were transferred onto SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrates in order to characterize the electrical properties of the arrays with the Si back-gate.38 Lithographically patterned metal pads (2 nm of Ti and 50 nm of Pd) were deposited to define 7 μm long CNT electrodes. CNTs outside this region were etched by O2 plasma to isolate devices. Devices were subsequently annealed at 400 C with Ar and H2 flow to ensure good contact between the metal pads and the CNTs. For the resistive oxide layer, AlOx was chosen because of its well-established conformal film deposition by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as well as the low reset currents reported.2 A ∼5.5 nm thick AlOx film was deposited by ALD using H2O and trimethylaluminum as precursors at 80 C for 50 cycles (∼1.1 Å/cycle).39 A second layer of aligned CNTs was then transferred32 perpendicular to the first CNT layer covered by AlOx. Lithographically defined electrodes were again deposited on the second CNT layer, and an isolation pattern was defined to remove excess CNTs. No annealing was carried out for the second CNT layer to prevent device degradation of the first CNT layer and of the AlOx film. Using the Si back-gate, CNTs in the first layer were identified as metallic or semiconducting prior to AlOx deposition. Since we cannot independently gate the top CNT layer, we assume metallic (or sufficiently doped semiconducting) when linear current_x0001_ voltage (I_x0001_V) characteristics were observed and semiconducting when nonlinear behavior was observed. All switching experiments were carried out at room temperature under vacuum (4 10_x0001_5 Torr) with a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system.",11,

192,"A voltage prestress was used to preform a Cu filament within the SiO2 layer. This improved the switching dispersion of the operating voltages and device resistances. The application of the voltage prestress resulted in a larger reuse sum and difference, which led to fewer sites of Cu filament formation/ rupture. A schematic model of the voltage prestress method was proposed. The voltage prestress generated a preformed Cu filament. Owing to the fast lateral diffusion of Cu, several nucleation sites aggregated into a larger nucleation site where a Cu conducting filament grows. Fewer sites of Cu filament formation/rupture in the stressed sample improved the switching dispersion.",58,
193,"BYO films are prepared, using pulsed laser deposition technique, and their electroresistance effect has been experimentally studied. Single-phase BYO films are obtained prepared under the temperatures from 300 to 500 ℃ and the oxygen pressure of 90 Pa. Electric field-induced resistance switching behavior is observed in the Ag/BYO/Pt structure. Postannealing in 750 ℃ improves the repeatability of the electroresistance and narrows the distribution of set and reset voltages for the resistance switching. A linear variation in reset current with resistance is obtained for the Ag/BYO/Pt systems either as-prepared or postannealed despite the great dispersion of these two quantities. A reduction in the activation energy, from ~0.63 to ~0.33 eV, for the migration of oxygen vacancies is also observed after the forming process. The occurrence of excessive oxygen vacancies after the forming process is believed to be responsible for this result.",16,
194,"In summary, we demonstrated resistive switching memory-functional QD-LEDs with V2O5–x HIL. In the comparative study on QD-LEDs with differently annealed V2O5–x layers, the resistive switching behavior of the QD-LEDs was attributed to the defect-abundant V2O5– x layer, as revealed by XPS, UPS, and HOD measurements. The resistive switching behavior of V2O5–x was discussed in terms of a conductive filament effect caused by oxygen drift and vacancy annihilation processes in the defective V2O5–x layer. We further demonstrated the on/off operation of QD-LEDs at the same drive current via a set/reset process. This type of resistive switching-functional QD-LED will enable significant advances for QD-LED displays and numerous integrated optoelectronic devices. ",21,

Additionally, conductive ﬁlaments were observed by TEM–EDX analysis. observed to form in the SiO2 layer. We propose that the RS phenomena in the Cu/SiO2/Au device occur with the connection and rupture of conductive ﬁlaments formed by Au-rich particles.",9,
196,"In conclusion, by using the fraction of the partial pressure across the “forbidden region” that occurs because of target poisoning in reactive sputtering, we were able to carefully control the stoichiometry of memristive devices over a range that is of particular technological importance and that is difficult or impossible in most standard deposition modes. Using this approach, we are able to maintain our stoichiometry control even as the absolute partial pressures and mass flow rates corresponding to the “forbidden region” shift due to changing conditions within the deposition chamber. Memristors were fabricated using partial pressure-controlled deposition and we were able to assess the role of varied asdeposited stoichiometry on memristor performance and eliminate the forming step. We found that although the existence of a large forming step is detrimental in terms of yield, devices that are forming free but have a high resistance asdeposited state have better yield and endurance than those that have as-deposited resistances in the range of switching resistances. It is possible that reducing lateral dimension of the devices will make devices with lower as-deposited resistances more desirable but, at least for large area devices, an as-deposited stoichiometry where x in Ta2Ox is approximately 3.3 results in the best combination of device properties.",26,
197,"On the basis of the aforementioned results, we conclude that we have successfully fabricated resistive memory with repair capability that enables it to function like a synapse. This device, even if its resistivity becomes low, recovers its high resistivity when a low bias voltage is applied to it. The device also exhibits characteristics such as long-term synapse potentiation when pulses are applied frequently within a short time period. Short-term plasticity is achieved by the Ta2O5 film functioning as a resistance-changing layer and the manganese oxide layer repairing sections with low resistivity. The results indicate that changes in resistivity occur at the interface between the tantalum oxides and the manganese oxides by XPS spectra and STEM mappings. Because this device has a simple structure, it should be ideal for embedding in a neutral network comprising complex circuits. Further evolution and development of the device presented in this study should bring us closer to creating devices that can simulate the human brain.",3,
198,"The values of RHRS and RLRS for different device areas can be found in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). Larger storage windows can be achieved with further scaling down the device area. Again, the multistate resistances at LRS (for different Icc) and HRS (for different Vstop) were observed for all devices with different areas. The EPIR change property was further investigated for the device with the cell diameter of 200 nm. Fig. 5(c) shows that all the resistance states of device can be repeated over 10^4 cycles with the endurance results measured at 2 V, 1.5 V, and 1 V erasing voltage pulses, respectively.

The Cu/a-C: H/Pt memory cells showed a device yield of 90% and a retention time of more than 10^5s. The dominant conduction mechanisms of LRS and HRS were Ohmic behavior and trap-controlled SCLC, respectively. The observed switching effect could be attributed to the formation/rupture of metal filaments due to the diffusion of the top electrodes under an electric field.",0,
200,"In summary, we investigated the effect of atmosphere (air, vacuum, O2 gas, or N2 gas) on BRS processes obtained in both top and bottom interfaces in the M/WO_3-x/Pt (M=Pt, Au) nanoionics devices. It is found that stable BRS only can be obtained in the interface with Pt electrode. Moreover, the resistance states and switching process occurred in top Pt/WO_3-x interface were highly dependent on the atmospheric characteristics, namely, the stable BRS behavior observed in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, like O2 gas and air, obviously degraded in vacuum or N2 gas. In contrast, the BRS process occurred in bottom WO_3-x/Pt interface did not influence by atmosphere. Based on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement on the top Pt and Au/WO_3-x interface, we propose that the oxygen migration mainly occurs between the Pt electrode and the Pt/WO_3-x interface during resistance switching process. The high catalytic activity and oxygen absorbability of the Pt electrode are indispensable for realizing stable BRS behavior in a Pt/WO_3-x interface.",10,
201,"In summary, we explored the effects of a strong electric pulse on the insulator-metal phase transition of VO2 films using synchrotron-based infrared microspectroscopy.

202,"A low temperature cryostat facility for a long HTS power cable has been designed, developed and tested for operation at around liquid nitrogen temperature. The cryostat uses MIL sheet material to achieve the necessary safety and quality. Based on the results of our numerical simulations, the cryogenic envelope, current lead, and several parts of the cryostat were designed. A non-destructive helium leak test, an over-pressure air tightness test, an over-voltage withstand test, and a cooling test were performed to confirm the quality of the cryostat. Eventually a performance test was conducted around liquid nitrogen temperature and indicated that the critical current (I_c) values of the cable conductor were 10.07 kA and 11.79 kA at 77 K and 73.7 K, respectively. The development of the cryostat was an essential step for the ongoing national project.

203,"In summary, we demonstrated ﬂexible organic−inorganic perovksite ReRAM using CH3NH3PbI3 thin ﬁlms as the resistive switching layer. Uniform surface morphology was achieved by a solvent engineering method. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite ReRAM showed low operation voltage of about 0.7 V, long data retention over 10^4 s, and good endurance properties. The memory devices also showed good mechanical ﬂexibility. Uniform and reliable programmable memory operations were obtained in tensile and compressive bent states. SCLC and Ohmic conduction were responsible for HRS and LRS transports, respectively. It is suggested that resistive switching was done by migration of iodide vacancies and formation of conducting ﬁlament under the electric ﬁeld. We believe that organic−inorganic perovskite materials have great potential to be used in ﬂexible memory devices in the near future.",12,
204,"In conclusion, we introduced the resistive memory switching phenomenon of an electroformed a-SiNx:H based visible LED. The optical read voltage of 2.5 V, resistance ratio between Light-ON and Light-OFF states of 33, data retention time of >78 years, and flash write voltage of 6.44 V are promising for the monolithic production of non-volatile LEMs. The exponential dependence of the switching time on the applied bias implies a field-assisted excitation of the charges trapped within the Si nanocrystallites whose overlapping wavefunctions form a sub-band transport level. The switching moment is interpreted as the breakage of this transport level when sufficient number of electrons are excited from the nanocrystallites. This proposed model for the switching mechanism is consistent with both the traditional conductive filament model for memristors and our previous works on the transport and luminescence phenomena for the similarly electroformed LEDs. Still, the kinetics of switching at the lowest switching times should be investigated in order to test the suitability of this device for the next generation high speed and large capacity optical memory cells.",-1,
205,"In summary, the resistive switching behavior of M-LCMO-M heterostructure was investigated. The fabrication of the M-LCMO-M heterostructure was compatible with the standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process. The improvement of the reproducible hysteresis and the resistive switching was observed by oxygen annealing. The interactions between nonlattice (mobile) oxygen and oxygen vacancies and/or the cationic vacancy contribute to the carrier transport (resistance) of M-LCMO-M heterostructure. With the accurate control of preparation parameters, good retention characteristics can be exhibited in M-LCMO-M heterostructure.",43,
206,"In this study, we investigated the RS properties of Pt/ STO/TiN devices from ALD derived Sr1+xTi1+yO3+(x+2y) thin films of various compositions. Metastable perovskite STO films were grown on platinum coated silicon substrates by ALD at 350 ℃ using cyclopentadienyl-based metal pre- cursors and oxygen plasma and a subsequent annealing at 600 ℃ in N2. STO films of 15 nm and 12 nm thickness and with three different compositions [Sr]/([Sr] + [Ti]) of 0.57 (Sr-rich), 0.50 (stoichiometric), and 0.46 (Ti-rich) were inte- grated into crossbar-devices with lateral dimensions varied from (10 × 10) μm2 to (100 × 100) nm2. Nano-structural characterizations by means of SEM and LC-AFM revealed a significant influence of the STO cation composition on the crystallization behavior and, thus, on the resulting morpholo- gies of the ALD films. Local defects in the film’s microstruc- ture dominantly affect the leakage current behavior of pristine Pt/STO/TiN cells and their soft-breakdown or elec- troforming voltages. For cell sizes >1 μm2 the HRS of the RS characteristics is superimposed by residual cell conduc- tivity. The polarity dependence of the RS curves and the area-independent LRS values serve as a direct proof of VCM-type filamentary RS taking place in the Pt/STO/TiN devices under study. Once the microstructural effects of the polycrystalline thin films have been assessed, a clear effect of the STO composition on the RS behavior was observed. Nano-crossbar devices from stoichiometric STO films could be switched at lowest voltages of about 1.0 V between the lowest LRS values of RON ≈ 40 kΩ and reasonable HRS val- ues of ROFF ≈ 1 MΩ determined at + 0.3 V. Non-stoichiometry in the ALD grown STO films, especially Sr- excess, increases the devices RON values, i.e., result in LRS of lower conductance.",2,
207,"In summary, we observed the real-time formation and rupture of the conductive filament inside Cu/MoOx/TiN. In the set process, the filament grew from the BE ( TiN ) toward the TE ( Cu ). However, it did not connect with the TE at the switching moment. It became thick with additional voltage application, showing a good retention property ( > 5 min ) at least for TEM observations. The filament size was controllable with the current compliance. In the moment of reset to HRS, no drastic change was observed in the filament: only a tiny area seems to contribute to the filament disconnection. When the current from the BE to the TE was increased, the filament disappeared and the resistance became larger. The shrinkage direction of the filament was from the BE to the TE, which cannot be explained by the standard filament model based on a redox reaction. Although the details are not yet fully clear, there must be a strong influence from the Joule heat of the current.",58,
208,"While it is easy to understand how oxygen ions are driven in and out of the channel vertically by an electric fi eld, there is no generally accepted theory to explain the lateral motion of oxygen ions in and out of the channel. One possible rationalization of the experimental observation is that Fick diffusion tends to drive oxygen ions in while thermophoresis tends to drive oxygen ions out. Fick diffusion dominates over thermophoresis during the OFF switching, where the higher electrical and thermal conductivity of the ON state channel distributes the heat more uniformly as power is applied to the device and the resulting temperature gradient is fl atter. Thermophoresis dominates during the ON switching, where a steep radial temperature gradient is produced by Joule ( I2 R where I is current and R is resistance) heating in the high-resistance OFF state with poor thermal conductivity.",19,
209,"Based on the above results and properties of the Ta-O system, we can now infer criteria for selecting other high-speed, highendurance, and low-energy memristors. A simple binary system is preferable, with only two thermodynamically stable phases in equilibrium, one insulating and the other conducting. The reliability of the memristor is directly linked to the absence of intermediate phases that could form in the conduction channel during the switching process. The Hf-O system also meets these requirements and is the only other system so far reported to have exhibited an endurance close to 10 billion.",-1,
210,"In conclusion, a precise approach to locate and directly image the key switching component was demonstrated on Ta oxide memristors that exhibited excellent electrical performance in many categories. The nanoscale area responsible for the switching was found to consist of an amorphous Ta(O) solid solution, surrounded by a stoichiometric and nanocrystalline Ta 2 O 5 . Together with the temperature dependent transport properties for various device states and reference fi lms, we argue that the switching observed here is the result of a composition modulation (oxygen concentration) of a conduction channel in parallel with a reservoir by the cooperative combination of thermal and electric fi eld effects. The microscopic mechanism of switching revealed by the detailed structure, composition, and electrical behavior of the conduction channel is key to engineering further improvements in the devices.",-1,
211,"Metal diffusion is investigated in hybrid Alq_3/Ag films and in ITO/Alq_3/Ag organic resistive memories. XRR analysis allowed correlating the evaporation conditions to the morphology of hybrid layers, showing that the interfaces are abrupt and the average diffusion of silver is weakly dependent from the evaporation rate (in the considered range); however, the presence of inhomogeneous diffusion is suggested by the decrease in the metal porosity which is observed at lower evaporation rate; this interesting fact indicates that the evaporation rate is likely to influence the switching behavior, in particular, the forming step and the resistivity in the HRS; we think that a systematic study on this phenomenon would be highly desirable; however, it is beyond the scope of the present work. ITO/Alq_3/Ag organic memories displaying regular unipolar bistable I-V characteristics and multi-bit storage capability have been characterized. In particular, programming capability with pulsed biasing was demonstrated in an endurance cycling test. Thanks to their very basic structure, consisting of only few chemical components, such devices were ideal candidates for the combined XPS and ToF–SIMS analyses. ToF-SIMS 3D imaging was performed on as-deposited devices showing the presence of ready-to-switch silver pre-filaments extending up to 200 nm in the Alq_3 layer. In our interpretation, the significant variability of the HRS conductivity relies on a conduction mechanism based on tunneling through multiple disconnected metal islands paths, on the other hand, in the LRS, one (or few) fully bridged CFs provide an ohmic path between the electrodes. In the NDR region, a local breakdown/oxidation of the CF occurs and a dynamic equilibrium may be established between the ruptured and formed CFs with distributed resistivities. Our results and interpretation are in close agreement with what has been recently observed in inorganic memoristors in which the NDR behaviour is explained by a process progressive degradation of (large) CFs.44 This work clearly demonstrates the high potential of depth profile techniques for the characterization of CFs in resistive switching memory stacks. Given the similarity, we suggest that CFs formation should also be taken into account when designing light emitting and photovoltaic organic electronic devices based on metallized thin organic layers.",20,
212,"In summary, the Ni/Al O /p+Si sandwiched structure is prepared by magnetron sputtering and the reset failure behaviors are investigated. It is found that the excessively short hopping distance of 0.66 ± 0.02 nm and the low hopping activation energy of 1.72 ±0.06 meV can lead to the unrecoverable breakdown of the Al2O3 dielectric layer, resulting in large leakage current and deteriorative memory window. 1.9 at. % ZnO doped into Al2O3 can introduce more oxygen vacancies in the switching layer, which not only eliminate the electroforming process, but also lower the working compliance current and operating voltage. In fact, a suitable concentration of oxygen vacancies and moderate switching parameters can avoid the overgrowth and insuﬃcient reset of CFs during the successive switching cycles. Therefore, the cycling stability and retention performance are improved accordingly. A physical model is developed to explain the oxygen vacancy aggregation and to understand the reset failure mechanism.",7,
213,"In conclusion, we have shown here unusual VC-NDR resistive switching followed by CC-NDR resistive switching induced by self-heating in BaCo1-xNixS2-y (nominal x = 0.1 and y = 0.2). These were due to the steep M → I transition upon heating followed by the activated behavior of the resistivity above the transition. The major role of Joule heating in switching is supported by the absence, or by the presence of only minor I(V) nonlinearity obtained in pulsed measurements. The back and forth I(V) switching is accompanied by a cooling-heating pulse that deserves further investigation.",27,

215,"In summary, we have demonstrated that the resistive switching characteristics of SRO/LFO/BFO/SRO composite devices can be improved by post-thermal annealing at relatively low temperatures in the range of 85–200 C. The postthermal annealing of the devices improves their resistive switching ratio and switching speed. Moreover, after the post-thermal annealing, the resistive switching ratio showed a dependence on the LFO-layer thickness, and the device-todevice variation in the resistive switching ratio decreased with increasing LFO-layer thickness. This result indicates that the thickness of the dielectric layer in dielectric/ ferroelectric composite devices can be used as a parameter for controlling the resistive switching ratio. These findings provide a guide for the improvement and control of the resistive switching characteristics of ferroelectric resistive switching devices.",-1,
216,"In summary, the resistive switching mechanisms in mem- ristors formed on monoclinic hafnia with low- and hi-Ov den- sities have been investigated. Gradual conductance modulation, STP, and LTP were implemented in HfO2 memristors using voltage-spike stimulation, suggesting suitability for electronic synaptic applications. The switching dynamics of the HfO2 memristor are explained by the interactions of Ov with grain boundaries. The passivation of Ov defects by nitrogen in the HfO1.86N0.14 film was confirmed by XAS. The HfO1.86N0.14 memristor exhibited threshold switching and CC-NDR. These findings suggest simple bilayer selector/memory cells could be fabricated from hafnia heterolayers.",26,
217,"A novel class of triindole-containing trinuclear alkynylgold(I) complexes has been synthesized, characterized, and employed in the fabrication of solution-processable resistive memory devices. Promising memory performances have been demonstrated with low switching threshold voltages of ca. 1.5 V, high ON/OFF current ratio of up to 105 , long retention time of over 104 s, excellent stability, and high repeatability. In addition, all the complexes have been shown to be capable of displaying spherical aggregates in aqueous THF solution. It is believed that the self-assembly process proceeds through a cooperative growth mechanism and has been driven by the π−π stacking interactions and hydrophobic−hydrophobic interactions between the central triindole moieties. The work presented herein opens up new opportunities for the development of novel organogold(I) complexes with intriguing multifunctional properties and provides important insights in the future design of versatile organometallic complexes.",60,
218,"In summary, we presented robust artificial synapses based on OTJs with the oxygen vacancy migration. The energy consumption of the two-terminal device is reduced to an ultralow level of femtojoules by exploiting an ultrathin oxide layer. Our experimental results provide evidence for various types of important synaptic functions such as STM, PPF, PTP, LTP, and LTD. By finely tuning the shape of the pre- and postsynaptic spikes, antisymmetric and symmetric Hebbian learning STDP forms are realized. Our artificial synapse based on OTJs represents a promising approach for energy-efficient brain-like computing.",74,
219,"In summary, the diffusion of oxygen atoms in HfO2 was  investigated by classical MD simulations using two different  empirical potentials. Higher temperature leads to a larger dif-fusion coefficient using both potentials, but at a fixed tem-perature COMB predicts higher diffusion coefficients than  MBKS. COMB predicts an activation energy of 0.53 eV.  MBKS predicts an activation energy of 0.36 eV for low tem-  perature and 2.2 eV for high temperature. A higher annealing  temperature consistently results in fewer three coordinated  oxygen atoms and more four coordinated oxygen atoms. The  greater number of oxygen atoms in annealed samples with a  CN of 4 than in amorphous samples indicates crystallization,  as indicated using either potential. Because various crystal  phases may appear in the annealed samples, the distribution  of Hf-O bond lengths is skewed compared to the amorphous  sample. The change in activation energy predicted by MBKS  at high temperature in an annealed sample may be caused by  a different diffusion mechanism due to the presence of crys-  talline structures inside the annealed sample.",35,
220,"In this article, we have reviewed the recent developments of smart textile integrated microelectronic systems for wear- able applications. It is evident that there has been a rapid increase in research activities and published work around the world. Many promising applications in health, IoT, smart city, robotics, etc., have explored and demonstrated. This article covers several main aspects of STIMES: the functional materials, three major fabrication processes of smart textile components, functional devices, system architectures and heterogeneous integration, wearable applications in human- related and nonhuman categories, as well as safety and secu- rity of STIMES. In particular, major types of textile integrated nonconventional functional devices are discussed in detail. They are mechanical, chemical and environmental sensors; shape actuators based on electrochemical, thermomechanical and other mechanisms, displays from additive and subtractive processes, antennas, mechanical, thermal, radiative energy harvesters and their hybrids, energy storage devices like bat- tery and supercapacitors, circuit boards, and memory devices. An important aspect, that is, safety and security of STIMES, has been added for the first time. The wearable applications of STIMES have shown great promises in health, sports, protec- tion and other related fields.",36,
221,"In summary, we have used a vanadium dioxide memristor to demonstrate an adaptive (“learning”) filter. This filter responds preferentially to signals of a specific design frequency by sharpening the quality factor of its bandpass. We also showed how the memreactive components including memory- capacitance and memory- inductance expand the suite of such adaptive filters. As mentioned, it has been shown that simple memristive filters can model the learning patterns observed in biological organisms.18 As memristive systems become more common and better understood, circuits such as the above two are likely to find uses in a range of electronics. In particular, we envision filters which initially enable low- Q broad- band detection but self- sharpen as needed when on- resonance signals are present. The analog functionality of memristive components may allow combination of traditional signal processing (such as these bandpass filters) with fuzzy logic and storage, potentially progressing toward the nonlinear analog- digital hybrid mechanisms found in biological systems. When considering potential applications of these types of circuits, it is important to note that although similar adaptive filters may easily be made with combinations of transistors, in the case demonstrated above the circuit consists only of passive basic circuit elements. In many situations, it is likely that a single memristive component may be far smaller than the combined active elements needed to emulate this behavior, offering advantages in device density and power consumption.",3,
222,"In summary, we analyzed retention behaviors of oxidebased RRAM at elevated temperatures and matched the experimental results with an oxygen vacancy diffusion model. Our analysis shows that the activation energy for oxygen vacancy migration can be directly calculated from the failure time versus temperature relationship. A non-monotonic conductance drift was also observed and can be explained within the oxygen vacancy out diffusion framework. Evidence for multiple filaments was also examined and supported by simulation. These findings support the filamentary model of RRAM devices and shed valuable insight in the design and optimization of oxide-based resistive switching devices for memory and logic applications.",46,
223,"In summary, we have reported the ferroelastic strain and magnetic field co-control of phase separation driven functionalities using a simple NSMO/PMN-PT multiferroic heterostructure. The bistable and nonvolatile resistance states can be in situ reversibly switched by applying appropriate pulse electric fields, which is closely related to the electricfield- induced 109_x0002_ and 71_x0002_ ferroelastic domain switching and induced intermediate in-plane strain state. Such a ferroelastic strain effect can be magnetically reinforced by 84%. Moreover, a visible reduction in the magnetoresistance was observed by the electric-field-induced ferroelastic strain at low temperatures. These results establish strong coupling between the magnetic field and the ferroelastic strain, which can be plausibly explained in terms of the phase separation model. Our findings provide a framework for realizing multi-field modulation of phase separation in complex oxides, which allows for the integration of an additional functionality (e.g., magnetic sensor) in the energy-efficient nonvolatile storage devices.",40,
224,"We systematically investigated the bipolar resistive switching characteristics, in particular XPS analysis of O 1s binding energy for the reset process, of various TiOx/TiOy bi-layer homo-junction structures. Bipolar resistive switching behavior appears to be due to oxidation/redox reactions at the interface between TiOx and TiOy, and the on/off ratio of memory windows can be controlled by controlling the number of oxygen vacancies (or ions) that participate in the reset process. A large oxygen chemical content in the TiOx layer leads to an increasing of non-lattice oxygen ions and the resistance value of HRS. Annihilation of the conduction filaments by oxidation was observed in our TEM analysis, and the presence of movable oxygen ions (or vacancies) was confirmed by XPS.",57,
225,"In summary, the switching dynamics was studied using the HfOx /AlOx devices as an example for the bipolar metal oxide resistive switching memory. This paper provides guidelines to design the energy efficient programming schemes for the high speed multilevel storage application.",0,
226,"In summary, the electric field tunability of resistive switching behavior has been further explored. Two completely different modes of non-volatile and pulsed resistive switching behaviors were investigated by tuning the in-plane read current value. In addition to the conventional piezostrain effect reported previously, the polarization current effect, generated by the drastic variations of polarization (dP/dt) around the coercive electric field, was found to play a vital role in tuning the resistive switching behavior. These results further broaden the application prospects of manganese oxides in multifunctional memory devices.",21,
227,"In conclusion, excellent rectification properties, a fast response to pulse signals, and the scalability to sub-100-nm sizes suggest that the CuO/IZO thin-film oxide diode is a feasible approach to switch elements for high-density, highspeed cross-point memory devices. The room-temperature growth and amorphous nature are very promising features that enable the application to complex 3D stackable memories and molecular devices.",0,
228,"Combining measurements of photochemical anionic dissociation, x-ray absorption and UV/visible dispersed fluorescence has enabled characterization of the state-selective dissociation dynamics of anionic and excited neutral fragments of gaseous SiCl4 following excitations of Cl 2p and Si 2p core levels. The transitions of core electrons to high Rydberg states/doubly excited states near both Si 2p and Cl 2p ionization thresholds of gaseous SiCl4 lead to remarkably enhanced production of anionic, Si− and Cl− , and excited atomic neutral, Si∗ fragments. This enhancement is attributed to the contributions from the shake-modified resonant Auger decay, Auger decay of doubly excited states, or/and PCI. These complementary results provide insight into the state-selective anionic and excited neutral fragmentations of gaseous molecules via core-level excitation. Negative photo-ion spectra and excited-fragment emission are powerful tools for the investigation of the dissociation dynamics of core-excited molecules.",35,
229,"In summary, Ge-based NVM is promising for future IoT applications thanks to its area and energy efficiency. Besides, this CMOS compatible technology is more competitive than other NVMs such as MRAM and PCM. The combination of germanium and memristor technology will make more improvements for future demanding memory applications.",23,
230,"We have reported a simple process to fabricate cross-shaped Cu-NW memristors using an inorganic-nanowire-digital-alignment technique and a one-step reduction process. The controllable alignment technique potentially solves the difficulties in aligning i-NWs to specified designs, enables rapid computerdesigned alignment of arbitrarily long continuous i-NWs on a large area, and can produce versatile patterns including straight lines, wave lines, and any combination of these lines. Scalable production of Cu-NWs with various alignments was achieved. A simple one-step reduction process was used to obtain metal– oxide–metal structure at the cross points of rectangular Cu-NW grids. This simple process facilitates fabrication of cross-point nonvolatile memristor arrays. The memristors showed repeatable resistive switching behavior, a high on/off current ratio ≈10^6 and stable data retention time for >2 × 10^4 s. This technique is applicable to aligning broad classes of compound precursors that are miscible with polymers in a solution to generate i-NWs and is an economical approach that retains all metallic elements in the final product. This is the first report of memristors with the resistive switching oxide layer self-formed, self-patterned, and self-positioned; we envision that the new features of the technique will provide great opportunities for future nanoelectronic circuits.",76,
231,"In summary, we have studied resistive switching in SiOx MIM RRAM devices in which switching is intrinsic to the oxide, due to the formation of conductive filaments generated by the movement of oxygen ions. The switching phenomena hence result from the intrinsic formation of conductive pathways within the SiOx, and not due to extrinsic factors such as metallic filaments as have been reported for metal-diffused SiOx layers. Equally, switching occurs in the bulk of the oxide rather than at the surface due to the formation of silicon filaments. At this time, we do not know the composition of the filaments, only that they are intrinsic to the oxide. We have used AFM, C-AFM, SIMS, and XPS to examine the structural changes occurring during the switching process. We observed bubbles forming at the surface of SiOx during switching, with those resulting from a positive form being significantly more elastic than those from a negative form. We explain this by movement of oxygen ions and the sub-surface accumulation of molecular oxygen, causing distortion of the sample surface. We also highlight the significance of the conductance quantum, G0, as the natural boundary between the high and low resistance states, and hence a quick test for the completion of the reset process. This can have important implications for device endurance and appropriate choice of the switching regime (e.g., current compliance).",25,
232,"In conclusion, the Au/Cr/Zr^+-implanted-ZrO_2 /n+-Si device is fabricated and investigated for nonvolatile memory applications. The implanted samples show good resistive switching behaviors. Moreover, it is found that the implanted samples exhibited larger resistive switching ratio and higher device yield than the unimplanted samples. The current of the implanted samples are governed by the trap-controlled SCLC conduction mechanism and the resistance switching is due to electron trapping and detrapping at Zr^+ traps in ZrO_2 film.",0,
233,"In conclusion, some key factors about the microscopic mechanism of resistive switch of Pt/ZnO/Pt have been investigated by first principles method. Around an isolated neutral oxygen vacancy, a high conductivity region formed by the O-deficient Zn(2-n)+ ions exhibits localized properties. The stability analyses show that the oxygen vacancies are inclined to forming a line structure in the neutral state and forming an isolation structure in +2 charged state so that the formation and rupture of the VO-filament structure can be triggered by hole/electron injection in ZnO film. The valence electrons corresponding to the extended defects of alignment of neutral oxygen vacancies show delocalized properties, and form a conductive channel in ZnO. Detailed analysis indicates that the conductive filament is formed by the aligned O-deficient Zn ions, because they are in reduced valence (lower valence) state of Zn(2-n)+. For the interface of Pt/ZnO, the neutral oxygen vacancy depresses the local Schottky barrier effectively where the electron injection from Pt cathode induces the transformation of V2+O to V0O which is in favor of forming the extended defects of aligned neutral oxygen vacancies. So the oxygen ion movement under applied external voltage and electron/hole injection induced the transformation of V2+O to V0O in ZnO are the two major factors leading to conductive filament formation and rupture in Pt/ZnO/Pt.",7,
234,"In summary, we found that the physical mechanisms of the forming process in unipolar resistance switching Pt/SrTiOx /Pt capacitors can be classified as purely electrical or thermally assisted dielectric breakdown according to the sweep rate or amplitude of the applied voltage signals. For thermally assisted dielectric breakdown, the thermally activated migration of oxygen vacancies/ions plays an important role in the forming process.",10,
235,"In summary, enhanced multilevel resistive switching performance was demonstrated with low variability in sput- ter deposited TiO2􏰁x thin films, which is attributed to the small size of CFs with high density of oxygen vacancies. The later has also a pronounced effect during SET transi- tion, imposing a gradual switching pattern, which indicates a TAT mechanism major contribution on the switching effect. At the same time, oxygen vacancy migration and their spatial distribution were also considered, in order to interpret the total current of the HRS and the self- rectification effect, respectively. Numerical simulations were also conducted in order to highlight the crucial role of temperature and gain insights into the origins of the switch- ing effect. Opportunities for low power and high uniform multilevel capabilities arise also by creating even smaller CFs with high density of oxygen vacancies.",34,
236,"Previous works have reported tuning of cobalt content from Co FEBID by electron-beam parameters such as current, acceleration voltage and dwell time. We have developed a simple and effective purification/tuning protocol of FEBID material produced with a Co2(CO)8 precursor, which relies on the post-growth annealing of the deposits under high vacuum. Low current density FEBID resulted in non-thermal adsorbate decomposition with 67 at.% of cobalt and high carbon and oxygen amounts in the deposit, while post-growth annealing deposits improved the cobalt content up to 85 at.%. The purification mechanism consists of oxygen release, from 19 at.% down to 1 at.%, while the carbon content remains approximately constant at 14 at.%. As-deposited samples show high C-O content and an anomalous conduction behavior successfully modeled by Mott’s variable-range hopping. In contrast, post-FEBID high-vacuum annealed samples present metallic characteristics. Improvements in electrical conductivity for 100 ºC and 200 ºC annealed films can be attributed mainly to Co nanocrystal formation and coalescence, oxygen release and graphite nanocrystal. The successful removal of oxygen reported in this study might explain both the lower average resistivity and the residual resistivity ratio compared to those previously reported in literature for Co-based nanostructures grown by FEBID. We believe that this post-growth procedure can be employed as an alternative purification/tuning protocol for other carbonyl precursors containing magnetic metals in FEBID experiments.",64,
237,"In conclusion, temperature irreversibility of resistive switching characteristics in an Ag/TaOx/Pt trilayer structure is explicated, under continual change of operation temperatures between 300K and 100 K. A mechanism based on the joint contributions of oxygen vacancies and Ag atoms in the conducting filament explains the disparity in forming/set voltages and reset current characters of Ag/TaOx/Pt devices operating at 300K and 100 K. More importantly, thepresence of oxygen vacancy segment will intervene the Ag redox reaction; therefore, the switching behavior of Ag/ TaOx/Pt device will not resume to the general Ag-only filament model even when the operation temperature is brought from 100K back to 300 K. Our study demonstrates that the conducting filaments in ECM memories with oxide electrolytes can be composed of both of metal atoms and oxygen vacancies. Consequently, resistive switching behaviors of ECM memories will be modified, depending on factors such as operation temperatures and defect concentration of the oxide electrolyte.",44,
238,"In summary, we showed the ability of silver dopant to enhance the thermal stability of germanium telluride serving as the electrolyte layer in metallic filamentary-type memristor. Functional devices were demonstrated, showing <5 ns switching capability and reliable performances. Incorporated in the high-density crossbar architecture, arbitrary logic of complete 16 Boolean logic could be implemented in two steps with the logic results in situ stored as the resistance state of the operating device. An additional read step is needed to read out the results. We believe our method may bring large amounts of memory closer to the computing elements, resulting in high-bandwidth, low-latency access for high performance computer to handle bigdata analytics, processing of large graphs in real time and other emerging machine-learning tasks With the ability to fuse memory and logic functions, it is conceivable that future computing chips may be much more compact and efficient than they are today.",53,
239,"In summary, a reproducible and bipolar electric-field-induced nanoscale resistance switching is observed at the interface of LAO/STO with d≥3 uc by a CAFM under vacuum environment. The switching behavior is suggested to mainly originate from the modulation of oxygen ion transfer in STO layer by external electric field in the vicinity of interface, Whereas the LAO films acts as a barrier layer.",25,
240,"The peculiar characteristics and the model of ReRAM switching of the Ti/TiO2 resistive material depending on the thickness of Ti are studied. The Ti layer deposited on TiO2 provides oxygen vacancies inside TiO2 during the annealing process. The amount of created oxygen vacancies can be controlled by varying the thickness of Ti and TiO2, which allows the control of resistance switching characteristics.",34,
241,"In summary, we fabricated reproducible and controllable Al/PEDOT:PSS/Al RRAM devices. The switching mechanism is attributable to the formation and rupture of filaments. The lowest reset power is 0.55 mW, and the critical Icomp for RS is 500 A. In addition, Icomp can be used to control the formation of the filaments and to optimize the performance of RRAM.",-1,
242,"A high-OFF/ON-resistance ratio NiO ReRAM is developed by the PPO process using N2O plasma after NiO deposition. The oxygen incorporation during the PPO process increases the film thickness of low surface density layers due to the effective oxidation of NiO films, and decreases the surface roughness due to the enhanced migration of atoms on the film surface. For integration of NiO ReRAM in Cu-BEOL on CMOS, the formation of leakage paths is effectively suppressed during the integration process, which results in a higher OFF/ON resistance ratio of 10^5 without any unintentional breakdown, a lower VF, and improved cellto- cell variation. The PPO process is a useful technique for integration of the NiO ReRAM in Cu-BEOL for embedded switch and memory applications.",44,
243,"In conclusion, we report an extremely sharp RS at room temperature in CFO/LSMO all-oxide magnetic heterostructure which is magnetically tunable with high sensitivity at fairly low magnetic fields. Remarkably, the switching does not show significant CFO thickness dependence in the absence of magnetic field but a strong CFO thickness dependence under applied magnetic field. We have discussed possible scenarios which can accommodate these observations reasonably well. We believe that the results reported in this paper add a “magnetic” dimension to the research on resistive switching.",-1,
244,"In summary, nonpolar RS behavior in the Pt/MgO/Pt memory device with the nonforming nature is demonstrated. RS behavior for the SET process is attributed to the formation of metallic Mg filaments, which is well supported by the AES and XPS results combing with the temperature dependence of the LRS resistance. The voltage-polarity- independent RESET process implies that local Joule heating may assist the rupture of filaments, leading to nonpolar char- acteristics.",0,
245,"In this letter, we have observed that the ZrO2/ZnO oxide heterostructures show completely different resistive switching behaviors with a set process in the different bias polarity. Our study demonstrates that the height of the oxide/oxide interface barrier for the migration of oxygen vacancies (or oxygen ions) plays critical role for this. The controllable and stable multistate memory is demonstrated in the Pt (bottom)/ZnO/ZrO2/Pt (top) oxide heterostructure. Our method opens up an opportunity to explore not only the resistive switching mechanism but also develop next generation high performance multistate memory through engineering oxide/oxide interfaces in oxide heterostructures.",7,
246,"TJs also demonstrate exciting perspectives at a basic science level. Combining epitaxial electrodes and ferroelectric barrier systems would enable investigations of the interplay between ferroelectric polarization reversal and the symmetry of tunnelling wavefunctions8 . FTJ coupling with magnetic electrodes has the potential to yield low-power electric-field-controllable spintronics device operation at room temperature. Furthermore, FTJs are emerging as ideal systems with which to investigate polarization switching mechanisms30 and high-frequency dynamics of nanoscale ferroelectrics, a virtually unexplored area.

247,"In conclusion, a facile synthetic route to obtain a water dispersed highly conductive PEDOT:Nafion composite was described. The relevant properties of the novel PEDOT:Nafion have been assessed by physicochemical standard techniques and in organic electronic device architectures. Despite there is still room for future investigations aimed at increasing the conductance of pristine PEDOT:Nafion films, fast ion transport and stability to delamination, even in the absence of adhesion promoters, make PEDOT:Nafion a useful multifunctional material in the realm of printable organic electronics. Furthermore, we believe that the incorporation of Nafion in a conductive matrix like PEDOT:Nafion will be particularly promising in the field of bio-sensing. Indeed, Nafion is one of the most effective ion transporter and is extremely selective towards cations thus, we believe that the incorporation of Nafion in a conductive matrix like PEDOT:Nafion will be particularly promising in the field of bio-sensing and bioelectronics in vivo.",48,
248,"In conclusion, we have discussed the potential of memristive MTJs for the optimization of MRAMs and magnetic FPGAs. We have shown that we can tailor the resistances of these devices and thus compensate for resistance fluctuations that occur as a result of the fabrication process. The MTJs maintain stable resistances and do not need to be periodically refreshed. For application in Spin Transfer Torque (STT)- MRAM an additional reset cycle needs to be implemented, because the high current densities necessary for operation will also trigger the resistive switching.",-1,
249,"In summary, we introduced a novel, facile, and scalable approach that shows how the uniformity of RS parameters for unipolar NiO resistive memory devices can be significantly improved by employing a simple procedure based on BCP self-assembly technology. Selfassembled SiOx-NDs were successfully formed between the electrode and the NiO active material, providing substantial reduction of operating voltage variations as well as HRS/LRS ratios. Growth and rupture of metallic Ni filaments in the amorphous NiO were directly observed through HRTEM and EDS analyses, demonstrating that the uniformly distributed SiOx-NDs can guide RS operation by selective filament growth/rupture. Our simulation analyses confirmed that the use of SiOx-NDs provided practical capability to modify the electric fields and temperature distributions in NiO memory. Considering the outstanding controllability, scalability, and large-area uniformity of BCP self-assembly, the findings of this study can provide a simple and practical solution to relieve the reliability issues in various filament-type resistive memories.",20,
250,"We have investigated the effects of relative humidity (partial water pressure) on redox reactions and ionic transport in a Cu/Ta2O5/Pt atomic switch cell. Our CV measurements revealed reversible oxidation and reduction reactions at the Cu/Ta2O5 interface in air when a sweeping bias voltage was applied to the Cu electrode. If the cell was exposed to dry conditions (5% RH), the redox reactions were significantly suppressed. When RH was increased, the current peaks associated with the redox reactions became dominant. The concentration of generated ions exhibited an increase with increased RH, indicating that water uptake supplies a counter charge=reaction at the counter electrode interface and plays an important role in the oxidation of Cu at the anode interface. Moreover, proton conduction may dominate the ionic transport at higher RH. The results demonstrate the important role that the uptake of water from the ambient atmosphere by matrix oxide film has on the fundamental processes in oxide-based atomic switches.",57,
251,"The logic operations in PCM differ from CMOS logic gates in at least three aspects. The fi rst difference is the nonvolatile nature of PCM states, which enables logic-in-memory applications where the same building block can serve for computing or memory depending on the initial confi guration. [25] This might be an advantage for achieving standardized logic circuits, where memory and computing are integrated on the same chip to allow better scalability and reduced interconnect delays due to the transfer of data from the memory circuit to the logic circuit. Nonvolatile behavior might also help to completely suppress the static power dissipation, which is a key concern in CMOS logic due to the subthreshold leakage of transistors. To reduce the off-leakage in computing circuits, alternative device technologies with improved subthreshold slope, such as nanoelectromechanical switches (NEMS) [26] and tunnel fi eld-effect transistors (TFET) [27] are currently being investigated. PCM logic, or any other logic approach based on nonvolatile memristors, might allow to achieve normally-off logic circuits with virtually-zero off-power consumption, thus enabling ultralowpower applications.",33,
252,"The second difference is the sequential operation in PCM logic, instead of the usually parallel operation in CMOS where one or more inputs are applied to a logic gate within the same clock pulse. Sequential operation cannot be avoided in PCMs because of the two terminal device structure of memristors. [7–9] For instance, NOT operation in Figure 5 requires 3 clock pulses (initialize, pull-up, pull-down), while it is accomplished in just one clock pulse in CMOS logic. However, the longer time needed to complete the single logic operation is balanced by a signifi cant reduction of occupied area, namely a single PCM as opposed to two CMOS transistors in the case of the NOT gate. Note that the PCM logic approach also allows for logic cascading, where a sequence of logic operations are carried out starting from one or more binary inputs and leading to one or more binary outputs. While cascading in a conventional CMOS logic circuit is achieved by direct connection of the output of a logic gate to the input of another logic gate, sequential cascading can be adopted in PCM logic, where the output of one logic operation ( e.g. , the AND operation of Figure S8) is used as one of the inputs of a second logic operation. This sequential cascade approach allows completing complex functions, such as binary addition, within several clock pulses.",33,
253,"The third difference is that, while CMOS logic relies on the gate topology to yield a certain functionality ( e.g. , the n-MOS/pMOS layout of the NOT gate or the 4-transistor layout of the NAND and NOR gates), PCM logic is simply based on memristive properties, e.g. , V T comparison and additive crystallization. The memristor plays therefore an active role in the computation through its memristive functionalities similar to a nanoscale abacus. This allows to develop reconfi gurable circuits where each PCM can provide any logic functionality depending on the initial confi guration. Such memristor-centric approach, however, has a disadvantage in the random nature of phase transition in PCM. Random nucleation and growth processes during crystallization may in fact lead to switching variability, where the fi nal state and its corresponding V T varies statistically for a given pulse width and amplitude during a logic operation. Crystallization variability can be due to either the statistical variation of the initial state, where the different chemical and structural confi gurations of the amorphous phase may result in different energy barriers for nucleation and growth, or to the stochastic nature of nucleation and growth, or both. The impact of switching variability can be reduced by adopting PCM devices and materials with relatively large V T . Another reliability issue inherently associated with the PCM switching concept is switching endurance, where extensive application of crystallization/amorphization pulses may result in degradation of the switching characteristics and eventually in a destructive failure of the PCM. An improvement of the switching endurance by material and device engineering might be needed to achieve a circuit lifetime comparable to CMOS technology.",33,
254,"In addition to the high functionality of phase-change effects, PCM also offers low-power computation, which can be achieved by confi ning phase change in nanoscale volumes [18] or in atomically-thin interfaces. [28] Also, the computing speed in the proposed PCM logic is not limited by external circuit elements, such as memcapacitances, [29] but is only dictated by the PCM switching time, which can be in the ns [30] or even sub-ns time regimes by priming the phase change material. [31] Clearly, PCM speed is yet not comparable to the typical switching time in the CMOS technology, which is around tens of ps thanks to a large drain current and small capacitance associated to the output logic gate. The limited PCM speed is due to the atomic transport required for crystallization, as opposed to the electronic transport in the CMOS concept. At the same time, the change at the atomic level allows nonvolatile logic in PCM, which is a key advantage to pursue normally-off logic. This supports PCMbased computing as a scalable, reconfi gurable, low-power and high speed alternative to CMOS logic.",33,
255,"In summary, temperature-dependent RS phenomena were observed in metal/STO/metal planar structure. The RS phenomena only emerge at the temperature higher than 340 K because oxygen vacancies can barely move at lower temperature. When the temperature is above 340 K, positively charged oxygen vacancies are thermally activated, producing built-in electric field. In the cooperative action of built-in electric field and external electric field, two resistance states appear. The increasing mobility of oxygen vacancies caused by higher temperature promotes the built-in electric field to reach equilibrium states quickly, and restrains the hysteresis loops. The existing of competitive behaviors in the device makes the resistance hysteresis loops reach a maximum value at 420 K. It is expected that the presence of the temperature field could play a beneficial role for a deeper insights into the resistance switching effect.",19,
256,"In summary, we have implemented a memristor-based optimization hardware that uses transient chaos in searching for global optimum of continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This transiently chaotic annealing is realized by gradually resetting the devices in the diagonal positions of the memristor crossbar, serving as self-feedback weights of Hopfield neurons, without introducing additional devices or circuit modules, therefore implying improved efficiency. Furthermore, the intrinsic nonlinear depression characteristics of TaOx devices can serve as an efficient and simplified annealing strategy, which can be achieved using simple pulse schemes. The potential of the transiently chaotic memristor optimizer has been experimentally demonstrated in both continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization problems, but the applicability of the approach may be extended to a large variety of optimization problems. This work could thus be of great significance for extending the capability of memristive systems from neural network accelerators to solving complex, real-world computation problems that are challenging for conventional digital computers. ",3,
257,"In summary, density functional calculations have been performed to assertain the impact of interfacial (001) bi-axial compressive strain in SrTiO3 upon the activation energy for diffusion of the electrically active oxygen vacancy, thought to be important in processes leading to electrical conduction (leakage current) in the use if SrTiO3 as a dielectric material. It was found that this strain induces a combination of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric distortive modes of phase transition in the SrTiO3, with displacement of oxygen ions along the [001] direction relative to the metal ion sub-lattice, and rotation of the oxygen-octohedra about the same axis.",2,
258,"The impact upon diffusion is highly dependent both upon the magnitude of strain, and upon the direction of migration relative to the [001]-direction. Up to 50% reduction in the migration barrier has been found for in-plane migration, suggesting that such diffusion would increasingly occur at room temperature with increasing strain. In contrast, since the activation energy for diffusion in the direction normal to the plane of strain is dictated by the D5 7 step, the effect of isotropic bi-axial strain in the (001) plane is to significantly impede the diffusion in the direction normal to the plane of strain.",-1,
259,"The barrier to injection of VO into an epitaxial film is maximised, according to the current calculations, where the strain is in the vicinity of 6%, which represents the maximum in the activation energy calculated in this study. The magnitude of the barrier, being round 1.5 eV, is sufficiently large to significantly reduce diffusion at room temperature in the absence of an applied electric field. Even at more modest strains, the impact of interfacial strain remains significant. At 2% strain, the in-plane diffusion remains approximately constant, but the inter-plane barrier has increased by about 35%–50% from 0.8 eV to around 1.1 eV with some variation with charge state.",2,
260,"In biased material, such as would be the case in capacitors or where SrTiO3 is present as an epitaxial gate dielectric, there would be an effective reduction in the barrier for charged VO, and an ion drift current may result in a thermal redistribution of these defects.",2,
261,"Nevertheless, the substantial diffusion anisotropy in compressively strained epitaxial material might be adopted as route to confine the diffusivity of these critically important electrically active defects. As such, strain may be viewed as a mechanism for the modification of leakage current in SrTiO3 thin-films.",2,
262,"NbO2 is the appropriate choice for IMT selector devices compared with VO2. The effects of the size of the NbO2 selector on the electrical performance and the impact of its characteristics on the overall 1S1R performance are investigated in this work. The results show that an increased L for the selector increases the Vth and Vhold but decreases the Ith. An L of 25 nm shows a good ability to reduce the leakage current of the RRAM. A large r decreases the Vth and Vhold but increases the Ith. An r of 7 nm can also decrease the leakage current of the RRAM. Therefore, the designed NbO2 selector has an L and r of 25 and 7 nm, respectively. The designed TiN/NbO2/TiN is employed as the selector device for the connection to the TiO2-based RRAM. Given the excellent selector characteristics of the TiN/NbO2/TiN device, the significantly improved RM (up to 27 word lines) for the RRAM can be used in large x-point memory arrays. Therefore, the design of the NbO2 selector is considered to be a success.",70,
263,"The conduction mechanism of antipolar resistive switching has been elucidated by developing a simple mathematical model, where the leakage current is sensitive to the location of oxygen vacancies relative to the electrodes. The application of a high voltage bias can drive oxygen vacancies near one electrode and switch the oxide into a high resistance state.

Multiple distinguishable, reversible, and nonvolatile remnant ferroelastic strain states can be obtained and multilevel resistance states with excellent stability and endurance in the Bi0.93Sb0.07 films have been realized by applying appropriate asymmetric bipolar electric fields across the PMN-0.29PT substrates. A relative change in the resistance of 7% was achieved at room temperature.

270,"This study reports a simple and economic method to modify the switching layer in organic RRAM based on PEDOT:PSS using commercial available PVP. After the treat ment of PVP with diluted content, PEDOT+ ﬁlament was more likely to form a linear rather than a coil conformation, and thus increased the ON-state current. On the other hand, insulated PVP particles dispersed in the organic layer. The loss of PEDOT:PSS and charge traps induced by PVP reduce the current in OFF-state signiﬁcantly. As a result, the diluted additive of PVP increased the ON/OFF ratio from 10^3 to 10^5. Moreover, the large ON/OFF ratio is stable for over 10^5 seconds.",69,
271,"In conclusion, we investigated thermally- or optically-biased memristive switching in the VO2-based device. With the temperature bias or the optical bias, a sequence of current pulses applied to the device allowed it to have subsequently decreasing multistate resistances (16 states at maximum), and the device could maintain its switched resistance state as long as the applied bias was not ceased. In particular, the effect of the pulse-free interval and the illumination power on the device resistance was also examined in the optically-biased case. It was observed that the illumination power and the pulse-free interval mainly affected the device resistances obtained by the first and second electrical pulses, respectively. Furthermore, the mechanism of the memristive switching was explained using a grain network model. The grain network model depicts the switching mechanism as the inhomogeneous and percolative transition in the VO2 thin film. This memristive switching property of the VO2-based device is expected to be applied to upcoming practical applications such as nonvolatile memory devices, crossbar latches, analog computation circuits, adaptive networks, and learning circuits.",26,
272,"In order to clarify the mechanism of resistance switching and memory effects in polycrystalline La-doped SrTiO3 ceramics, the measurements of resistance switching and memory effects and complex impedance analysis have been performed. Multilayered chip devices composed of polycrystalline La-doped SrTiO3 ceramics and Pd electrodes exhibit large resistance switching after an appropriate forming process. The resistance changes by over two orders of magnitude at both the voltage polarities. Furthermore, both the HRS and LRS can be memorized over 10 h at room tempera-ture. The resistance state between the HRS and LRS can also be switched by the application of different-polarity voltage pulses.",2,
273,"According to the complex impedance analysis, it is clarified that the resistance change is attributed to the change in the resistances of the grain boundaries and electrode interfaces. These results demonstrate that in La-doped SrTiO3 ceramics, resistance switching originates from the change in the resistance of the DSB and Schottky barrier. In particular, the DSB has a great influence on the resistance switching effect. The on/off cycling endurance tests show that the devices can achieve 1000 times the on/off switching with a resistance change of two orders of magnitude. However, the degradation of the resistance in the HRS is caused during the repetition of the on/off switching and the magnitude of the resistance change decreases. These degradation phenomena can be attributed to the deformation of the DSB and Schottky barrier derived from a decrease in the interface states and/or migration of the O vacancies. The R-t measurements at various temperatures demonstrate that the LRS is switching to the HRS during the measurements and the relaxation speed from the LRS to HRS strongly depends on the temperatures. These results indicate that the LRS is unstable as compared to the HRS and the relaxation of the resistance in the LRS can be attributed to the relaxation of electrons at the interface states and/or migrated point defects. From these experimental results, it can be considered that the resistance switching in SrTiO3 ceramics originates from a change in the resistance of the DSB and Schottky barrier. Furthermore, it is speculated that the resistance memory effect could be derived from a change in the space charge near the interfaces; the migration of the point defects changes the distribution of the space charge near the interfaces, resulting in a change in the number of trapped electrons at the interface states.",2,

279,"Double-layer RRAM cells with Ni/SizNx/SiO2p+-Si structure were fabricated with a comparison group of singlelayer devices with Ni/Si3N4/p+-Si structure as shown in Fig. 1(a). RRAM cells with Si bottom electrode (BE) in this work have several advantages over the conventional devices with metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure in the sense that BE can be easily formed without complicating the back-endof-the-line (BEOL) and higher flexibility in physical design of RRAM devices is available compare with the MIM devices. Fig. 1(b) shows the double-layer RRAM cell fabrication process flow. In order to form BE with high conductivity, SiO2 with a thickness of 60 À was grown by dry oxidation as the buffer layer. Then, ion implantation of BF2 was carried out at an acceleration energy of 40 keV and with a dose of 1 x 10^5 cm^-2. The buffer oxide was removed by diluted HF solution followed by a drive-in process at 1050°C for 20 min, where lattice damage curing and dopant activation were accompanied. Next, SiO2 as the tunnel barrier and Si3N4 as the switching layer were deposited by mediumtemperature oxidation (MTO) at 783 °C and low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) at 785 °C, in sequence. The thicknesses of tunnel barrier and switching layer were 2.5 nm and 5 nm, respectively. Two additional RRAM cells with single-layered Si3N4 thicknesses of 5 nm and 7.5 nm were fabricated for a comparison study. Finally, Ni top electrode (TE) was deposited by a thermal evaporator, and then, TE was patterned by a shadow mask containing circles with 100-um diameter. All electrical characterizations were performed by DC voltage sweep mode using Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer.

The NF in the LRS can be increased by controlling I_CC and the thickness of the tunnel barrier layer. We also demonstrated multiple stable resistance states by tuning I_CC and VSTOP. High endurance was achieved in the Al2O3-embedded device because of its strong resistance against reset failure.

In analogy to its electrical counterpart, we added a sinusoidal thermal input across the two terminals. During a cycle, we observed a pinched Lissajous type q-T curve, which is the direct evidence of a thermal memristor. We found that the increase of temperature amplitude Ta and thermal conductivity ratio r results in a stronger memristive effect. We also achieved dynamic negative differential thermal resistance and obtained a closed loop in the κeff–T curve, both achievements showing further similarity between thermal memristor and electrical memristor. Considering the unique thermal properties of the thermal memristor, we expect it will be useful for the applications of thermal energy storage, neuromorphic circuits, and spintronics.",26,
284,"We have shown that rose bengal thin films sandwiched between a ZnO or ITO bottom electrode and aluminum or titanium top electrode show resistive switching. By leaving out the molecular layer and depositing aluminum directly onto ZnO, we are able to exclude the molecular layer to generate the switching.",-1,
285,"It is proposed that filaments of either aluminum (titanium) or ZnO grow through and short circuit the molecular layer. At the interface of ZnO and aluminum (titanium), a thin layer of aluminum oxide (titanium oxide) is formed. Due to the strong similarity of the switching of the rose bengal devices to the switching of an Al2O3 layer and due to the enhanced Al2O3 signal at the RB/Al interface obtained with TOF-SIMS, it is suggested that the switching is completely extrinsic, i.e., generated by the thin aluminum oxide layer at the interface.",16,
286,"However, it has to be noted that the results presented here do not exclude that rose bengal can show a molecular switching effect in other experimental setups. In fact, in the on state the molecular layer is short circuited by metallic filaments so that any molecular effects will be masked. Therefore, no conclusion about the molecule and its ability to switch can be drawn. Furthermore, the magnitude of the currents shown here is higher than observed by Bandyopadhyay and Pal.13 They also observed switching in rose bengal devices contacted by different top electrodes, e.g., mercury top electrodes,16 which hints that the effect they observed has a different origin. However, the switching effect observed in our devices is a more general mechanism which may be in operation in other molecular devices also.",27,
287,"In this paper, we show that the bipolar-switching proper ties of Al2O3- and HfO2-based RRAM cells deviate consider ably when the operation current is kept below the corner value I_op < 15 μA associated to an incomplete voltage snap back during forming/set operations. We attribute these deviations (e.g., R_LRS, R_HRS, I_reset) to the very different intrinsic switching characteristics of RRAM dielectrics in the soft breakdown regime, as compared to the usual characteristics obtained in the progressive breakdown regime (I_op> 15 μA). Using scaled cells, as required for careful switching characterization in the sub-μA range, we evidence, in particular, that R_HRS is largely affected by the defect chemistry of the dielectric material in the SBD regime due to the increased impact of single-V_o defects over sub-band characteristics. We also show that the switching variability originates from both (i) the large impact of single V_o-defect variation on the current level controlled by only few particles (n_c < 15) in the QPC constriction, and (ii) the variations of geometry parameters (not only ω_y but also ω_x) of the constriction itself. In addition and importantly the variability is largely affected by the V_o-defect chemistry of the dielectric material through the modulation of the CF shape. Based on these insights, we finally show that the engineering of an Al2O3/HfO2 bilayer is effective in optimizing the switching and the CF shape for an improved trade-off in terms of increased memory window and minimized variability.",11,
288,"In summary, TEM combined with FTIR experimental results approve that introducing Ar gas can enlarge the size of GB and increase the oxygen vacancies when the BST films are grown. It can be observed that the Ar-introduced BST films possess better RS properties than the O2-grown BST films, which verify that the large sized GB and suitable increase in oxygen play a crucial role in RS effects. Ions’ conductivity caused by oxygen vacancies is not dominated as charge carriers in the BST thin films according to the activation energy. The present results suggest a useful way to improve the RS properties and provide a better insight of RS mechanism based on the BST films.",19,

295,"In summary, rich and interesting AMR behavior was observed for the unique Ni conducting filaments formed in NiO RS samples, including normal AMR with a positive AMR ratio (two different OP MR behaviors in the LRS), anomalous AMR with a negative AMR ratio, superposition of normal and anomalous AMR, and even sign change of the AMR ratio with decreasing temperature. We also observed TMR behavior in some samples with the HRS, which is a new breakthrough, indicating a nano-MTJ can be realized in the Ni filament just by the RESET process. Furthermore, through the experimental results and first-principles calculation, we provide an in-depth understanding of the Ni conducting filament in NiO RS samples, such as the size of Ni filaments related to the RS effect, microscopic evolution process of the filaments in the RS process, and the location of the filaments’ rupture region.

296,"In summary, we report a tri-state RS behaviors manipulated by electric and magnetic fields for the Au/BFO/LSMO heterostructure. By changing the direction of the ferroelectric polarization, the resistances of the heterostructure can be switched among three stable states without an electroforming process. It is found that the non-volatile RS behaviors in our sample are attributed to co-contributions of Schottky-like barrier in the Au/BFO interface, the resistance changes of BFO/LSMO interface, and the domain wall density manipulated by polarizations. Most interestingly, the room-temperature current peaks near Vc owning to the high conductivity of ferroelectric DWs prove the negative MR properties of ferroelectric DWs macroscopically. The above findings are helpful for us to understand the effects of interfaces and the ferromagnetism of ferroelectric DWs in multiferroic heterostructures on the non-volatile RS behaviors, which may give a possibility for combining RS device with spintronics.",40,
297,"In summary, the electrode dependence on resistive switching does not result from the work function or from the metal electrode/NiO contact but instead is a result of the free energy of formation of metal oxide compared to Ni oxidation. The metal oxide created at the interface between NiO and the metal electrode affects the resistive switching characteristics due to the metal oxide breakdown that occurs at the anodic site. Additionally, it was found that migrated atoms have an effect on the resistive switching properties. This study demonstrates the mechanism of the metal electrodes and the reset process in NiO-based RRAM in an effort to elucidate the criterion for selecting the metal electrode.",43,
298,"In summary, we have conclusively disclosed the physical scenario associated with the three-level resistive switching in n-Si/SiOx/LCMO/Ti devices. The contribution of three regions (metallic filament, manganite and SiOx layers) to the transport properties has been individualized. Our results show that the existence of the native SiOx layer plays a key role in the stabilization of an intermediate resistance level, indicating that the combination of two or more active RS oxides in single devices improves their functionalities.

300,"The millimeter-sized planar device based on the polycrystalline VO_2 film was fabricated to investigate the low frequency current SO. No current SO were observed in the circuit with the external capacitor less than 2 μF connected in parallel to the device. The investigated current SO of 2 Hz were obtained with a 5 μF capacitor. The temperature distribution in the VO_2 film was studied at different moments within one current SO period. At the current pinching in the film, the high-temperature channel lifetime was about 60 ms, with the oscillation period being 560 ms. To compare it to the experimental data, the temperature distribution in the VO_2 film was calculated within the thermal model framework accounting for the 2D electric current flow and heat transfer in the planar device. The channel was found to form in 4 ms, and the maximum temperature in the channel reached 1000 K, with the simulation being in a good agreement with the experiment. The rapid temperature distribution dynamics in the film was observed near the MIT temperature. The slow temperature distribution dynamics was observed at temperatures below the MIT temperature determined by the external capacitor charging. Although the external capacitor is required to excite the current SO in the millimeter-sized planar device, in micron-sized ones the intrinsic electric capacitance at the MIT is large enough to sustain the current SO without any external capacitor. Based on the experimental data and modeling, the current SO mechanism in VO_2 was analyzed based on the current pinching and dielectric relaxation processes in the film at the thermally initiated MIT. The results of this work could be applied to predicting the characteristics and performance of VO_2-based systems.",49,

303,"The process of forming ReRAMs [Pt-Ir/NiO(50-nmthick)/Pt-Ir test devices] was investigated by means of in situ TEM using a piezo-controlled specimen holder with simultaneous I-V measurements. Starting from the initial state, the resistance abruptly decreased at about 2 V. At the same time, a bridge with a width of 40–50 nm was formed. This bridge was very conductive while the surrounding region demonstrated insulating properties. The resistivity of the region at the grain boundary was relatively low and the bridge may have appeared selectively in the grain boundary region. Alternative reset and set phenomena have not presently been attained with the TEM apparatus. For a more detailed discussion on the mechanism responsible for the operation of ReRAMs, we need to confirm reversible switching during TEM observation and find the composition of the bridge.",1,
304,"In conclusion, the forming-free and self-compliant BRS behavior of the Cu/TaOx/TiN device was investigated. The Cu TE serves as an active electrode that enables low voltage switching and forming-free characteristics. The RS was operated by formation and rupture of combined Vo/Cu CF. The TiON interfacial layer between TaOx/TiN lead to self-compliant switching even in CBRAM device. Although the operation current level was high, the feasibility of the self-compliance in CBRAM brings a great benefit to the crossbar array application.",11,
305,"In summary, we have successfully demonstrated the a-BN- thickness-dependent CBRAM characteristics and in situ Ag diffusion during sputter deposition into a-BN thin film. The devices are found to be in LRS or HRS as their pristine states depending on the thickness of the a-BN. The initial resistance state of the devices was due to the Ag diffusion within the a- BN thin film. A thinner a-BN layer (5.5 nm) has a high amount of diffused Ag, leading to LRS in the pristine state, while HRS appears in a thicker a-BN (21.5 nm) switching layer due to the small amount of diffused Ag. Regardless of the initial resistance states, the subsequent switching of all devices was found to be bipolar with SET at positive and RESET at negative voltage. The ION/OFF values increase significantly with increasing a-BN thickness. Device stability such as retention, endurance, and humidity response was affected by a-BN thickness. For the programmable CBRAM cells with a-BN switching medium, the thickness must be either less than or equal to 5.5 nm or greater than or equal to 21.5 nm in this study (device M3). Our finding surely explains the role of metal-ion diffusion or migration for the a-BN-based memory device applications with respect to various switching medium thickness ranges.",49,
306,"In conclusions, the local doping method of Al-doped HfO2 RRAM device was proposed in the consideration of inducement and controlling of the CFs’ growth process. By the combined action of the trivalent doping and the electrical filed concentration, the thinner shape and less amount of connected CFs are expected to be formed in this device. Excellent uniformity, endurance, and operation current performance were achieved in prepared sample. Using the local doped device, we obtained well controlled multiple switching states either in the DC sweep mode or in the pulse operation mode, proving the validity of the optimization method. Further works are expected based on this design guideline, such as using the nanofabrication technology.",24,
307,"In conclusion, we report a study of resistive switching in silicon-rich silicon dioxide films grown by co-sputtering. Our results suggest that conductive pathways are formed at grain boundaries by the field-driven nucleation of oxygen vacancies. Such pathways are not continuous, but are chains of silicon nanoinclusions separated by a highly substoichiometric oxide matrix. A combination of applied field and Joule heating controls the distribution of oxygen vacancies, which is reflected in changes in the device resistance of four orders of magnitude or more. Our memristive RRAM device differs from those previously reported by not requiring diffusing metallic contacts,5 and not being limited by surface conduction to vacuum operation.4 The resistive states are stable, switching pulses can be 90 ns or shorter, and switching currents are around 10 lA. Such devices are very promising for application in memristive systems such as high-density semiconductor memories. We note that further investigation (underway) should yield more detailed insight into the microscopic switching mechanism.",-1,
308,"In summary, we proposed a Si-introducing method to enhance the resistance switching characteristic of the WOX RRAM. The diverse oxidation states in the WOX film were providing the stochastic conduction paths, which lead to the irregular resistance switching behavior. In this research, the Si interfusion in WOX resistance switching layer can effectively localize the filament conduction paths to improve the resistance switching property.",1,
309,"In summary, we investigated nonlinear conductivity and resistive switching in polycrystalline and single crystalline samples of V3O5. Self-heating induced in all samples hysteretic nonlinear conductivity followed at higher currents by onset of NDR. A very slow switching occurred in polycrystalline samples at currents below the onset of NDR, often leading to only partial transition and long memory. Above the onset of NDR switching was fast for both poly- and single-crystals, and for high enough currents, the entire sample became metallic. IMT in the whole sample was verified by the minimal value of V/I lying in the metallic range of R(T). Homogeneous heating of the sample up to~450 K even for long durations had no effect on R(T). Self-heating by high currents which is inhomogeneous induced dramatic changes in a single crystal, appearance and disappearance of a VO2 inclusion or just changes in oxygen stoichiometry (see supplementary material for the single crystal SC1). These undesired changes were prevented in the second crystal (SC2) by limiting the range of currents to the values that barely induced metallic resistivity.",27,
310,"In summary, the crossbar- type SD was fabricated and characterized. The Pt/TiO2/TiO2_x0005_x/Pt SD where the TiO2-x quasi- Ohmic contact layer formed by the in situ oxidation of 100- nm- thick Ti layer during the TiO2 ALD played an important role in the resulting highly promising performance, in terms of extremely high forward current density and rectifying ratio, of the SD. The local conduction paths in the fabricated SD seem to provide sufficient forward current to operate an RS memory cell stably, even in a few tens of nanometer scaled CA device. An high forward current density of ~ 3 × 10^5 A/cm2 and rectification ratio of 2.4 × 10^6 were confirmed down to a 4 μm2 area in the crossbar- type SD.",24,
311,"We have demonstrated that periodically PE Mg:LN yields highly functional p-type conductivity behavior that can be controlled by the polarity of the sample and applied electric field, UV illumination, as well as sample composition. Upon UV exposure, three conductivity states were observed, which are (i) ON: continuous current flow on _x0002_z and þz Mg:LN under application of negative voltages at the bottom electrode, (ii) OFF: high resistivity state on þz Mg:LN at positive voltages applied to the bottom electrode, and (iii) intermittent: intermittent current flow on _x0002_z Mg:LN upon application of positive voltages to the bottom electrode. The domain walls showed enhanced continuous and intermittent conductivity whereas the Mg:LN–PE phase boundaries exhibit pronounced intermittent current flow only on the þz sample. The threefold switchability of conductivity states and tailorable internal interfaces through ferroelectric poling and introduction of PE phases yield potential applications as UV sensitive micro- and nanoelectronic devices. Without UV illumination, the movement of Hþ ions within the PE phase leads to capacitive currents at low voltages (up to 610 V). However, under application of high voltages (tens of V), inner PE phases exhibit memresistive and rectifying conductivity due to electrochemical reactions at the bottom electrode–PE phase interface, which allows for practical use as solid electrolytes as well as bistable memristor devices. The insight gained into charge transport upon varying conditions facilitates applications of periodically PE Mg:LN in multifunctional electronic devices and might also be applicable to similar semiconducting and/or ferroelectric materials.",50,
312,"In this paper, we have reported a volatile switching phenomenon achieved with 5 nm thick titanium dioxide film based devices. The switching is abrupt between a very high insulating state and a metallic-like state. The device physics can be explained with the presence of a NiO layer between the TiO2 and nickel bottom electrode and by the meta-stable formation of a metallic filament. During the forming, the filament is formed and the vacancies locally change the electronic structure at the interface between TiO2 and NiO. When the bias is applied, the electric field induces a distortion of the local electronic structure, allowing the current to flow. The LRS is maintained until the electric field is removed. Afterwards, the internal electromotive force triggers the ionic diffusion. The thermal energy available to the system enhances the ionic movement and achieves the self restoration of the HRS. In particular, the high temperature enhances the ion diffusion coefficient contributing to the filament dissolution. This mechanism could be exploited in the realization of a cost-effective selector device for ReRAM crossbar arrays due to its high non-linearity and maximum current, fabrication compatibility with current crossbar processing, and scalability.",1,
313,"In summary, the resistance switching characteristics of polycrystalline Nb2O5 thin films prepared by atomic layer deposition have been investigated for possible nonvolatile memory application. The resistance ratios of HRS to LRS can be kept to be more than 10 during the 1000 cycles of fatigued test which is big enough for practical memory usage (a ratio of 3). The retention characteristics of devices tested at room temperature show both the HRS and LRS are stable for more than 5 * 10^4 s and does not induce any degradation. Excellent electrical properties of the devices for NVM application obtained in this study shows Nb2O5 is a very promising candidate for nonvolatile memory application.",-1,
314,"We successfully fabricated the Ti/ZrO2/Pt resistive switching devices by a simple sol–gel process. In the ZrO2-based resistive switching devices, unipolar resistive switching behaviors including bistable memory and monostable threshold switching were measured. The device exhibiting a multilevel resistive switching under different current compliances was studied. As the compliance current increases, the relationship between Roff and Ron shows three successively regions—the linear, nonlinear, and breakdown regions. To achieve stable switching properties, the resistive switching devices should work in the linear region. Physical mechanisms based on the CF model are responsible for the resistive switching phenomena and the device breakdown. The figure of merit Z of the ZrO2-based switching device is higher than 10^3. In this study, the memory device with good properties such as unipolar resistive switching, multilevel resistive switching (at least six levels), good scalability, low operation voltage (<5 V), high OFF/ON resistance ratio (>10^3), nondestructive readout, long retention (>10^4 s), and simple fabrication method is fabricated. Such a ZrO2-based switching device has promising applications in next-generation nonvolatile memory.",0,
315,"In conclusion, we demonstrate that the essential key for optimal amplifying STT is to keep the phase difference between the precessional motion of the mean magnetization and the AC frequency small. As long as they act in-phase a combination of an AC and a DC can decrease the critical switching DC density of this superposition. With a constant AC frequency the phase difference can only be kept small for longer times in a very narrow range marginal below the eigenfrequency f0. Thus, the resonance effect is very sharp. The eigenfrequency depends on the material constants and on the shape of the used layers, so it is possible to address them selectively and reliably. This is valid for realistic memory bits of appropriate size. A further decrease of the critical switching DC density can be accomplished by using a dynamic AC frequency, which follows the precessional frequency of the magnetization.",-1,
316,"In summary, OFF and ON currents, the ON to OFF current ratio, in PVP–graphene composite based memristive devices using three fabrication approaches were studied. It was concluded that, among the three approaches for active layers fabrication by varying combinations of graphene ﬂake and PVP, the blended approach was better compared to semiblend and layer by layer approaches. The fabricated devices showed better robustness to multiple voltage sweeps at lower compliance current of 100 µA compared to 5 mA. For 100 µA CC the memristive device based on blended approach had ROFF/RON ≈ 5, which was better in stability as well as magnitude when compared with the devices fabricated by other two approaches. For non-blended approaches devices showed R_OFF/R_ON of approximately 3. The presence of graphene ﬂakes in present form did not enhance memristive behavior of PVP instead the device’s behavior was similar to graphene oxide based memristor.",-1,
317,"In conclusion, in this study we have shown improved switching of oxide electrode on single crystal Nb:STO, which can be directly related to the defects present at the oxide electrode structure and interface region. A pulse switching speed of 1 ㎲ with reasonably large resistance window and endurance is observed. The defect chemistry and the interface state are crucial for metal/semiconductor contacts. The study further enhances the knowledge about resistance switching mechanism and can be applied for other combination of materials interfaces.",16,
318,"HPs have been investigated to determine whether, in addition to optoelectronics, they could be applied to memory, transistor, and artificial synapse devices, given their exotic properties of fast carrier and ion transport, tunable bandgap, majority carrier control, and superflexibility. Here, we have focused on the exotic properties of HPs, HP film preparation for memory and transistors, and HP applications beyond optoelectronics. The I–V hysteresis of HPs, which is caused by fast ion migration, makes it possible to realize resistive-switching memory and artificial synapse devices. As opposed to memory devices, field-effect transistors make use of the carrier-transport property of HPs, indicating that the suppression of hysteresis is the more effective approach. In a logic device, HP films are directly deposited on a hydrophobic metal surface, in contrast to solar cells in which films are formed on a hydrophilic compact- TiO2 surface. Thus, improvement of HP film fabrication methods is required to realize pinhole-free thin films for application to logic devices. This will need a careful examination of antisolvents, additives, vapor deposition, and metal surface treatments.",28,
319,"Here, we have suggested the possibility of fabricating HP logic devices, emphasizing low-cost and low-temperature synthesis, a low power consumption, and mechanical and compositional flexibility. As shown in Figure13, a wide variety of HPs can be realized with compositional flexibility, which is a major strength of HP applications. However, very few studies have addressed HP logic devices. Corresponding research in this field will have to be conducted to overcome the limitations of film preparation and stability and profoundly understand the intrinsic properties of HPs. To date, various efforts have been made to increase film quality and device performance of HPs. To improve the film quality and the performance of devices, the use of antisolvents, additives, vapor deposition, and the treatment of the metal surface can be considered. Regarding the stability issue, surface passivation against ambient conditions has been introduced to enhance not only the photostability but also device performance. One of the representative limitations of HPs is the environmental impact of the toxic lead elements in HPs, given that those based on lead exhibit an intrinsic superiority. However, this can be resolved through the application of a water-based lead-recovery process, which recovers the lead ions in HPs into an aqueous solution. The amount of lead in a 1 m2 perovskite solar-cell module is the same as that in a 1 cm2 layer of natural soil of an equivalent area. Thus, it should be possible to overcome the problem of environmental impact.",-1,
320,We believe that logic devices fabricated from these fascinating materials will be promising candidates for commercial applications in the near future with progress in device fabrication and the material itself. Further research should resolve the existing problems facing next-generation devices.,33,
321,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated that resistive switching in Fe-doped SrTiO 3 thin fi lms can be either confi ned to a single strong fi lament or distributed over larger areas beneath the electrode, in the ideal case the whole junction area. Both types of switching coexist in one and the same sample and exhibit the opposite switching polarity. We suggest allocating those two switching types to areas of different defect density beneath the same electrode.",2,
322,"Concerning device scaling, these results imply that resistive switching in SrTiO 3 thin fi lms can in principle be extended over the whole junction area if the formation of thermally generated strong fi laments is prevented during an appropriate electroforming process.",2,
323,"In conclusion, a simple sandwiched structure of Pt/CoO/ITO was presented and adopted to work as a selector with threshold switching. Its electric conduction is dominated by the trapcontrolled SCLC. The threshold switching is brought about by the transition from the trap-unfilled to the trap-filled SCLC owing to the injection of high-energy holes into the CoO layer that is a ptype oxide semiconductor, which is consistent with the symmetric I–V characteristics that suggest bulk hole conduction. The Pt/ CoO/ITO selector exhibits very small variations of Vth and quick switching within 50 ns, without the first fire process. This high performance will help in enhancing and achieving a highly integrated 1S–1R array with a cross-point structure.",0,
324,"In conclusion, we show that ultrathin few-layer HfS2 can be incor- porated into a variety of vdW heterostructures and selectively trans- formed into an amorphous high-k oxide using laser irradiation. In contrast to sputtering or ALD, the use of photo-oxidized HfS2 al- lows for clean interfaces without damaging the underlying 2D ma- terials. We demonstrate that the laser-written HfOx has a dielectric constant k ~ 15 and a breakdown field of ~0.5 to 0.6 V/nm. These properties allow us to demonstrate several promising high-quality vdW heterostructure devices using this oxide: (i) ReRAM elements that operate in the voltage limit of ~1 V; (ii) flexible TMDC-FETs with Ion/Ioff > 104, subthreshold swings of 100 mV per decade, and good resilience to bending cycles; and (iii) optoelectronic devices based on quantum well architectures, which can emit and detect light in the same device, with EL intensities and drive voltages comparable to devices with hBN barriers and photodetection response times up to 106 times faster than equivalent planar MoS2 devices. Moreover, the high-k dielectric constant, the compatibility with 2D materials, and the ease of laser-writing techniques (58) will allow for signifi- cant scaling improvements and greater device functionality, which we predict to be an important feature for future flexible semi-transparent vdW nanoelectronics.",1,
325,"We reported the control of the grain sizes in BA2PbBr4 films by changing the TT of the VAT. The PbBr2 film, which was deposited by thermal evaporation, was transformed to BA2PbBr4 by exposing it to the organic vapor; this process induced complete conversion to the BA2PbBr4 film.As TT increased, the average grain size increased as ∼180nm at 100°C, ∼1μm at 150 °C, and ∼30 μm at 200°C.RSM devices based on BA2PbBr4 that were deposited at TT = 100, 150, and 200°C showed bipolar RS behavior.Also, IOFF decreased as the grain size increased. The proposed method to synthesize the BA2PbBr4 film with different grain sizes could extend the applications of 2D OIHP materials to advanced memory applications.",-1,
326,"In this work, the superior memory behaviors of N2-plasma-treated SiNx RRAMs and stacked GdOx/SiNx RRAMs were demonstrated. With an increase in the con- centration of nitrogen vacancies in the SiNx RS layers through the N2 plasma treatment, excellent memory char- acteristics such as low set/reset voltages (−1.3/1.6 V), a high resistance ratio (>two orders of magnitude), and stable cycling endurance (>100 cycles) and data retention proper- ties (>10^4 s) were achieved. The reduced Schottky barrier height at the Ir/SiNx interface of the SiNx RRAMs was obtained owing to the N2 plasma treatment on the SiNx ﬁlm surface. In addition, the stacked GdOx/SiNx RRAMs present a multilevel RS operation with two additional middle resistance states (MRS1 and MRS2) through an unbalanced formation and rupture of the conductive ﬁlaments, owing to the different dielectric permittivity and Gibbs free energy of the GdOx and SiNx ﬁlms. The carrier transportation mechanisms of the stacked RRAMs at HRS and middle resistance state (MRS) were examined to be a Schottky emission and SCLC, respectively. Stacked GdOx/SiNx RRAMs with a data retention behavior of more than 104 s and a resistance ratio of more than one order of magnitude between each resistance state were realized, which are suitable for future artiﬁcial intelligence applications with high-density storage requirements.",-1,
327,"For the dielectric in CBRAM, we investigated theoreti- cally the physical mechanisms that determine the Ag conduc- tive ﬁlament growth mode and morphology. The dielectric serves as the solid-state electrolyte, where certain properties of Ag and Ag+ inside the electrolyte have been shown to be the key factors. The following conclusions can be drawn:",18,
328,"Our ﬁrst ﬁnding is that the charge status of Ag interstitial in many solid-state electrolytes is ﬁxed by the electrolyte materials. For instance, in a-Si, the Ag interstitial tends to be neutral because Ag+ very easily captures the elec- trons from the dangling bonds of Si. On the other hand, in GeSe and ZrO2, the Ag interstitial maintains a certain amount of positive charge, the amount of which is also mainly dependent on the electrolyte material. However, in SiO2, there can be two distinct stable charge states for Ag, with charges of +0.16 e and +0.72 e, respectively, according to the Bader analysis. Hence, in SiO2, the elec- trochemical reduction of Ag+ may occur either at the electrode interfaces or inside the electrolyte.",18,
329,"Provided that Ag+ is unstable inside the electrolyte, like the case of a-Si where Ag+ can be reduced automatically to Ag, the CF typically consists of multiple Ag clusters inside the electrolyte, because these neutral Ag intersti- tials have high possibility to accumulate. Since they are almost electrically neutral, their migration is not quite directional, which promotes their horizontal movement and the accumulation.",18,
330,"In case Ag+ can be stable inside the solid-state electro- lyte, its mobility is the key factor to determine the direc- tion of CF growth, which is consistent with previous reports. When the migration barrier for Ag+ is extremely high, such as 2.48 eV for ZrO2, the CF can only grow from the active Ag electrode, since the ionic ﬂux is lower than the electronic leakage current that can reduce Ag+ near the anode surface.",18,
331,"In fast cation conductors such as some chalcogenides, the mobility of Ag+ can be very high, such that the CF grows from the inert electrode. Yet, the morphology of the CF can be either conical or dendrite-like. If the cation possesses a large solvation shell that can exchange charge with the surrounding environment, and its mobil- ity is not extremely high, dendrite CF is supposed to emerge since the solvated Ag+ can easily be attracted to the tip of the virtue cathode made of the CF. The move- ment may not only be across the capacitor, but may also be in horizontal directions. Otherwise, Ag+ tends to reach the cathode side (the cathode metal electrode or the virtue cathode) across the capacitor to render standard conical CFs.",18,
332,"It should be emphasized that these rules are limited to Ag CF formation, which is the simplest case because only nominally +1 cation exists for Ag. In terms of Cu-based CBRAM, it is more complicated because a Cu cation can be either +1 or +2 charged nominally. However, the same methodology can be applied to study the Cu CF morphology in future works.",18,
333,"In conclusion, it has been experimentally shown that the RS behavior of Cr:SrZrO3 depends strongly on the chemistry of the Cr-rich domain near the top electrode. The optimum RS behavior was observed in the films that were grown at high substrate temperature 700 °C which induces Cr migration to the surface region and postannealed at low oxygen partial pressures PO2 10−5 Torr which maintains the valence of Cr ions as 3+. The abundance of the stable Cr3+ appears to be prerequisite for appreciable RS behavior in Cr-doped SrZrO3.",2,
334,"In summary, we have implemented a memristor-based optimization hardware that uses transient chaos in searching for global optimum of continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This transiently chaotic annealing is realized by gradually resetting the devices in the diagonal positions of the memristor crossbar, serving as self-feedback weights of Hopfield neurons, without introducing additional devices or circuit modules, therefore implying improved efficiency. Furthermore, the intrinsic nonlinear depression characteristics of TaOx devices can serve as an efficient and simplified annealing strategy, which can be achieved using simple pulse schemes. The potential of the transiently chaotic memristor optimizer has been experimentally demonstrated in both continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization problems, but the applicability of the approach may be extended to a large variety of optimization problems. This work could thus be of great significance for extending the capability of memristive systems from neural network accelerators to solving complex, real-world computation problems that are challenging for conventional digital computers.",3,
335,"In summary, we have shown that the presence of screw dislocation exits in the substrate surface has a great impact on the electrical properties of MIM structures fabricated from resistively switchable Fe-doped SrTiO3. The drastic changes in growth environment close to the dislocations result in polycrystalline defects that act as fast-forming sites due to their higher electronic conductivity and increased oxygen diffusion through local Joule heating. These findings highlight the demand for extraordinary control over the defect structure of oxide materials for future memory applications.",2,
336,"To conclude, in this letter, we have demonstrated that the progressive reset transition between the low and high resistance states in HfO2-based RS devices can be modeled using a diode-like conduction mechanism with a series resistance in combination with a generalized logistic model for the pre-exponential diode current amplitude factor. The proposed dynamics has been interpreted in terms of the sequential deactivation of multiple conduction channels spanning the dielectric film. Fitting results indicate that the switching behavior dynamics can be described by the same equation regardless of the voltage sweep rate. Finally, partial reset I-V curves were characterized and modeled using the same approach, which gives further support to the proposed picture. ",5,
337,"In conclusion, we report a bistable resistance switching behavior of CuO thin films. The impedance spectra support that the resistance switching could be CuO bulk-related effects, resulting from repeatedly ruptured or generated filamentary conducting paths by external biases in the CuO matrix. From the CAFM study, we observe that the resistance switching of CuO thin films is related to the forming of conducting paths generated by the external bias. We think that CuO thin films can be considered as a candidate of ReRAM devices and need further studies for the definite understanding of the bistable resistance states.",9,
338,"To summarize, in this article we optimize an oxidation process of a Ni layer allowing the fabrication of Ni\ NiO\ Ni cells having the attractive property of exhibiting both the bipolar and unipolar switching modes. By showing electrical results obtained for both modes, we put forward the electrical signatures of different mechanisms involved in the two modes. The unipolar switching is discussed as driven by thermal-based mechanisms, while electrical fingerprints of voltage-controlled electrochemical reactions are evidenced for the bipolar switching. These latter reactions are allowed by the easy oxygen-based ionic movement through defect- based channels in the cell. These aspects were not reported yet for NiO materials. The switching versatility between these two modes is observed both for large oxidized Ni films and for Ni oxidized within contact holes. Hence, the perspective of selecting the desired switching mode in a scaled device made of a single hole is highly attractive because the specific advantages of the two modes broaden the application scope of the cell.",-1,
339,"Crystalline PCMO films are known as p-type materials, but the APCMO films grown at temperatures below 500 _x0001_C in this work are n-type. This suggests that many defects such as oxygen vacancies and metallic defects were formed in the APCMO film, and these behave as electron sources. The APCMO film grown on the ITO electrode functions as a bipolar switching device, but the APCMO film grown on the Pt electrode exhibited unipolar resistive switching behavior, indicating that the resistive switching behavior of the APCMO film depends on the electrode type. Electroforming was required to obtain the unipolar switching behavior, and the resistance in the LRS was independent of the size of the top electrode. Therefore, the formation and rupture of the conductive filaments are responsible for the conduction in the LRS. According to the XPS analysis, the oxygen vacancies contributed to the formation of the conducting filaments. Finally, since the Pt/APCMO/ PteSi device exhibited reliable retention behaviors at RT and also showed stable resistive switching properties, it can be concluded that the APCMO film is good candidate film for ReRAM devices.",27,
340,"In summary, we report forming-free TiW/Cu2O/Cu memristive devices with bipolar switching characteristics, and reveal the conducting mechanisms by I-V curve fitting, R-T relation, and impedance analysis. The temperature dependence of resistance for LRS shows non-metallic conducting behavior, indicating that the bipolar switching behaviors are caused by the formation/rupture of filaments formed by copper vacancies. Schottky emission and Mott’s variable range hopping contribute to the microscopic conducting process of the memristive devices.",28,
341,"In summary, we report the first integration of transition-metal-doped tin dioxide thin films on ferroelectrically and piezoelectrically active 0.71Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.29PbTiO3(111) single-crystal substrates in the form of ferroelectric field effect devices which enable us to obtain a reversible and nonvolatile tuning of electron carrier concentration and its related electronic properties of the SnO2:Co films. Combining the ferroelectric gating with the PFM, XRD, Hall effect, temperature-, film thickness-, and illumination-dependent electronic transport measurements, a large nonvolatile modulation of the resistance of the 15-nm SnO2:Co films by ~330% was achieved through the polarization switching of the PMN-0.29PT at room temperature and we demonstrate that such modulation of the resistance is due to the electric-field-induced polarization charges at the interface but not the electric-field-induced lattice strain. We further rigorously disclosed that both the magnitude and the sign of the magnetoresistance of the SnO2:Co films are intrinsically determined the electron carrier density which could modify the s-d exchange interaction of the films, advancing the understanding of the physics of carrier-density-mediated magnetotransport properties of transition-metal-doped oxide semiconductors. Using the ferroelectric gating and UV light illumination multilevel distinct resistance states with a maximum ∆R/R=448% was achieved for the SnO2:Co/PMN-0.29PT FeFET structures which may have potential applications in multistate resistive memory and electro-optical devices.",4,
342,"In summary, we have found that an epitaxially and coherently grown heterojunction of SRO/Nb:STO shows rectifying I–V characteristics agreeing with that of a Schottky junction composed of a deep work-function metal and an n-type semiconductor. Well-developed hysteresis is formed so as to alter the junction resistance lower (higher) upon forward (reverse) bias stress. The presence of the resistance switching effect in a heteroepitaxial structure should give a due to elucidation the mechanism and also to enhancement of the device performance as memories in terms of atomic scale interface engineering.

343,"In summary, a solution processed RRAM with a double layer of Al-In-O/InOx was demonstrated at a low temperature of 180 ℃. The device exhibits free resistive switching characteristics and stable electrical performances on a flexible substrate. Oxygen vacancy conductive filament formation and rupture model were used to explain the resistive switching behavior. The Al-In-O spontaneous-formed layer in the double structure plays a role in the formation of the oxygen vacancy conductive filament. First principles calculations reveal that the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy was reduced seriously by the addition of indium atoms into the AlOx layer. It results in the formation of an oxygen vacancy conductive filament at a low electrical field. The solution processed Al-In-O/InOx bilayer with a low process temperature is expected to be applied in the next generation of printed flexible memories.",-1,
344,"In summary, this work has tested the performance/tolerance of a memristor-based Willshaw network and showed that the impact of the two types of analyzed defects in memory performance is distinct: stuck-at-1 defects are more amenable and can more easily be compensated through an increase in the readout current threshold, as they show a slower decrease of the network capacity with increasing defect percentage. Furthermore, we tested device parameter variations and found that it is critical to control device-to-device resistance variance, more than threshold voltage variance. Our findings show that memristor defects and variability do not imply (to some extent) the catastrophic failure of a network’s operation (here a Willshaw associative memory) and can in fact be overcome by using a wellinformed operation strategy.",8,
345,"In conclusion, this study sheds light on a new possibility for antiferromagnetic materials. It is found that antiferromagnetic PtMn exhibits the SHE with a magnitude comparable to that of nonmagnetic Ta and Pt, in addition to the exchange bias. The two effects lead to a SOT-induced switching of the perpendicular magnetization at zero fields in a PtMn/[Co/Ni] bilayer system. Furthermore, a memristive behaviour arises as the exchange bias increases. The AFM/FM system thus offers a new avenue for the electrical manipulation of magnetization and its application in solid-state devices and neuromorphic computing.",8,
346,We have considered how the instability of memristor nanostructure properties can be related to the manufacturing conditions. It is necessary to allow the physical properties of amorphous wide-bandgap semiconductors used in memristor active structure to reduce the instability effects.,26,
347,"In summary, we have improved the memory characteristics of the a-IGZO-based ReRAM cell using hydrogen postannealing methods. In comparison with the sample postannealed in the Ar gas environment, the sample post-annealed in Arþ H2 gas environment was able to achieve uniformity in the set and reset state currents with lower current distribution, and exhibited larger current ratio and better retention and AC endurance due to the hydrogen passivation effect. These results indicate that we can further improve the performance of the oxide-based ReRAM devices using a simple hydrogen postannealing process",5,
348,"The Brewster angle microscope was used to deduce the molecular tilt angle of domains of a stearic acid monolayer on water through quantitative analysis of the micrographs. This technique was thus demonstrated to be a valuable means, not only to visualize monolayers, but also to quantitatively characterize them.",68,
349,"In summary, the RRAM device with Pt/InOx/TiN structure exhibits bipolar RS behavior. The RS behavior is unstable during initial switching cycles and then tends to be stable after several more switching cycles. According to the analysis of LRS electrical conductance, the ACP will be decreased during switching cycles. The stable RS behavior can be attributed to the set process stability brought about by enhancement of the tip electric field caused by reduced ACP. In addition, the current in SM decreases abruptly during the reset process since the speed of the oxidation reaction is enhanced by the serious Joule heating effect which has been induced by the smaller ACP. Hence, the smaller ACP leads to a reduction of the set voltage and HRS current. The relationship between the resistance and ACP can be further confirmed by varying the current compliance. The resistance values of LRS and HRS increase with decreasing current compliance owing to the reduction of the ACP. Since power consumption is an important issue for portable electric product applications, the RRAM device in this study can achieve the low power consumption due to its low switching voltage and operating current characteristics.",-1,
350,"The Ca_ii H & K absorption lines have been used for two centuries to study a host of astrophysical phenomena. In this paper, we have extended the use of these lines to the circumand inter-galactic contexts by measuring the galaxy–Ca_ii gas spatial correlation function. Using spectra of about 10^5 quasars from the SDSS DR7 data set, we have measured the mean Ca_ii absorption around one million low-redshift galaxies with median M∗ ∼= 10^10.3 Mol/L on scales ranging from about 10 to 200 kpc. This statistical technique allows us to probe absorption lines down to rest equivalent widths of several milliangstroms and to be sensitive to the total amount of Ca_ii around galaxies.",15,
351,"The detection of absorption features relies on the ability to accurately estimate the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of the background source. To do so we have used the continuum estimates presented in Zhu & Menard (2013), based on a vector decomposition technique. The analysis presented in this paper is based on the cross-correlation between galaxy positions and the flux decrements in the background quasar spectra. It has allowed us to obtain the following results.",15,
352,1. We detect Ca_ii H & K absorption out to projected galactocentric distance r_p ∼ 200 kpc (about virial-radius). This is about an order-of-magnitude farther out than previous studies based on individual absorber detections. Our sensitivity allows us to probe Ca_ii column densities down to about 5 × 10^10 cm^−2.,15,
353,"2. The mean spatial distribution of Ca_ii gas around galaxies follows a power-law column density profile with a slope α = −1.38 ± 0.11, at r_p < 200 kpc (see Equation (7)), which is steeper than an isothermal profile. We estimate the total Ca_ii mass in the halo within 200 kpc to be ∼5 × 10^3 Mol/L, averaged over the foreground galaxy population. This is an order-of-magnitude higher than the total Ca_ii mass in the Milky Way disk, suggesting that more than 90% of Ca_ii in the universe is in the circum- and inter-galactic environment.",15,
354,3. The amount of Ca_ii in the halo is larger for galaxies with higher stellar mass. We find that the mean Ca_ii absorption at fixed virial-radius-normalized impact parameter is independent of stellar mass. This suggests that the Ca_ii mass in the halo is more closely related to the dark matter halo mass rather than the total stellar content of galaxies.,15,
355,5. For edge-on galaxies we find that Ca_ii is preferentially distributed along the minor axis (in the polar direction).,15,
356,These results provide new constraints on the gas distribution around galaxies and bring new elements to our understanding of the cosmic baryon cycle. They also provide quantitative challenges for theoretical models for galaxy formation and evolution.,15,
357,"In contrast to the strong SFR dependence of metal lines, there appears to be no statistically significant difference between the Lyα absorption by neutral hydrogen around star-forming galaxies and that around quiescent ones (Thom et al. 2012), suggesting that neutral hydrogen and metals in the halo could have very different origins or be distributed separately in phase space.",15,
358,"2. The amount of Ca_ii in the halo is correlated with stellar mass. This dependence is shallower than linear, such that the total Ca_ii mass is more closely related to dark matter mass than stellar mass. This may have the same cause as the mass–metallicity relation—the metallicity of interstellar gas decreases with stellar mass because metals are more easily expelled from low-mass galaxies due to their shallower gravitational potential. This will result in higher metal (halo)-to-stellar mass ratio for lower-mass galaxies. It is interesting to note that Churchill et al. (2013) had similar results regarding Mg_ii in the halo, and Tumlinson et al. (2011) found that the total O_vi mass in the halo shows even less dependence on stellar mass.",15,
359,"Large and homogeneous surveys of the sky have allowed us to probe the distribution of matter in low-density environments. From the SDSS only, we now have measurements of the galaxy–galaxy correlation function from clustering analyses (e.g., Masjedi et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2012), the galaxy–mass correlation from gravitational lensing (e.g., Mandelbaum et al. 2006), the galaxy–dust correlation from reddening measurements (Menard et al. 2010) and, from the work presented in this paper, the galaxy–gas correlation function obtained by measuring statistical absorption by metals. These new observational probes are providing us with a more complete description of the matter distribution around galaxies.",15,
360,"This analysis shows the potential of using the ever-growing data from large surveys for absorption line studies. The automatic continuum estimation method presented in Zhu & Menard (2013) and the cross-correlation technique presented in this paper are generic and readily applicable to any large data set from ongoing and future surveys such as BOSS (Schlegel et al. 2009), eBOSS (Comparat et al. 2013), BigBOSS (Schlegel et al. 2011), and PFS (Ellis et al. 2012).",15,
361,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the stacked α-Fe2O3 /Nb–SrTiO3 RRAM devices possess Schottky-like characteristics with a significant anticrosstalk ratio of RLRS-R/RHRS-F, while the typical bipolar resistive switching behaviors with excellent uniformity, retention, and endurance performance are maintained. These unique device characteristics exhibit the potential of the α-Fe2O3 /Nb–SrTiO3 stack applied in the cross-bar memory arrays for multilevel storage. The anticrosstalk ratio correlated with set current compliance is observed in the LRS that suggests that the carrier injection and trapping mechanism dominates the Schottkylike rectifying I-V behavior of the α-Fe2O3 /Nb–SrTiO3 stack-based devices.",0,
362,"In conclusion, the cross-point circuit has been shown to provide a one-step solution to linear regression and logistic regression, which is demonstrated in experiments with RRAM devices. The one-step learning capability relies on the high parallelism of analog computing by physical Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s law within the circuit and physical iteration within the nested feedback architecture. The scalability of the cross-point computing is demonstrated with large problems, such as the Boston housing dataset and the MNIST dataset. The results evidence that in-memory computing is remarkably promising for accelerating ML tasks with high latency/energy performance in a wide range of data-intensive applications.",59,
363,"The rich hysteretic i–v characteristics detected in many thin-film, two-terminal devices can now be understood as memristive behaviour defined by coupled equations of motion: some for (ionized) atomic degrees of freedom that define the internal state of the device, and others for the electronic transport. This behaviour is increasingly relevant as the active region in many electronic devices continues to shrink to a width of only a few nanometres, so even a low applied voltage corresponds to a large electric field that can cause charged species to move. Such dopant or impurity motion through the active region can produce dramatic changes in the device resistance. Including memristors and memristive systems in integrated circuits has the potential to significantly extend circuit functionality as long as the dynamical nature of such devices is understood and properly used. Important applications include ultradense, semi-non-volatile memories and learning networks that require a synapse-like function.",8,
364,"In summary, we have studied the nanoscale resistive switching (RS) with the approach of the C-AFM. The dimensions studied are as small as 3 × 3 nm^2. Multimode RS is observed. The filament conduction cannot be explained by the tunneling (TUN) model and is explained in the frame work of a low defect quantum point contact (QPC) theory. Moreover, we propose a method to enhance the nanoscale RS stability by increasing the volume of the conductive filament (CF) and the number of defects contained in the QPC",43,
365,"In conclusion, we have observed the reversible alternation of bipolar and unipolar resistive switching in polycrystalline perovskite BST thin films. When the switching voltage exceeds a certain threshold voltage, the devices exhibit unipolar switching while for switching voltages below the threshold voltage, the devices shows bipolar switching behavior. The LRS of the bipolar switching state is identical with the HRS of the unipolar switching state. We can explain",-1,
366,"In summary, the locally conductive carbon-based film was successfully prepared through catalytic graphitization of amorphous carbon. The homogeneously dispersed Ni nanocrystals played a vital role in the graphitization process. Thanks to the electrical properties and micromorphology characteristics of the locally conductive carbon film, the optimized graphene oxide based RRAM devices demonstrated outstanding RS uniformity and reliability. In contrast to the two kinds of reference memory devices, the relative fluctuations of the HRS/LRS resistance value were reduced from 139.6%/76.9% and 63.5%/46.5% to 31.4%/7.5%, while that of Vset/Vreset value decreased from 50.5%/47.7% and 22.5%/24.4% to 7.7%/6.9%, respectively. In addition, the graphene oxide based RRAM devices with the locally conductive carbon insertion layer also showed good endurance and retention characteristics. Therefore, the application of homogeneous carbon-based materials with specific microcharacteristics is an effective method for improving the RS reliability of graphene oxide based RRAM devices.",32,
367,"Resistive switching characteristic of amorphous YCO film was discussed. The Pt/YCO/Pt device showed stable unipolar RS behavior with excellent endurance and retention. The RS mechanism based on the filamentary (thermo-chemical) model was suggested to explain the switching phenomenon where the conductive filaments formation was mainly ascribed due to the electromigration of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the I-V characteristics revealed the Ohmic and SCLC conduction mechanisms in LRS and HRS of the Pt/YCO/Pt device, respectively. This study proposed a possible application of YCO in non-volatile memory application.",-1,
368,"In conclusion, the spatial distribution of the oxygen vacancies under electric field in different resistance states was revealed in the Ti/HfO2/Pt device, based on the comparison of the XPS spectra of Hf 4 f signal in oxide films, accompanying with EELS spectra analysis. The spatial dependence of the valence of Hf element suggests oxygen vacancy defects could not be uniformly distributed in the tested devices. A dynamic model of RS processes was proposed that the oxygen vacancy clusters dominantly determines the resistivity by the connecting/rupture between the neighbor cluster sites in the bulk. Our study could provide extended deep understanding on the formation of conductive filament in RRAMs devices.",10,
369,"In summary, we presented a simple approach of building multilevel ReRAM by connecting two different bipolar switching elements. The simple, merged bipolar switching element had three distinguishable resistance states (LRS, IRS, and HRS), highlighting the possibility of high-density ReRAM with an ML function at each crossbar point. Experimental observations suggested that the ML switching events relied on electrically induced oxygen ion drifts at interfaces between the top/bottom Ta 2 O 5Àx and middle TiN/ TiO x N y layers. In addition, a concept for writing multi-states and an erasing method were briefly suggested.",1,
370,"We fabricated devices with structures consisting of ITO/ PMMA/graphene/PMMA/Al (device I) and ITO/PMMA/ graphene/PMMA/graphene/PMMA/Al (device II). Devices I and II exhibited binary and ternary nonvolatile memory characteristics, respectively, implying that the number of switching states might be affected by the number of graphene sheets embedded in the PMMA layer. A comparison with the I−V curves of the device without graphene showed that the conductance of device I in the HRS could be explained by the TCLC model. In addition, the C−V curves and SCM images revealed that the graphene sheets acted as charging and discharging layers, and the resistive switching was caused by the trapped charges in the graphene layers. These results demonstrated that devices consisting of graphene sheets embedded in insulating polymer layers might be applied to multilevel nonvolatile memcapacitive devices as well as memristive devices.",73,
371,"Silicon oxide, while being one of the most-studied of all oxides, continues to exhibit novel and rich structural and electrical behavior under electrical stress. In this review, we have summarized recent work that demonstrates the great potential of this most CMOS-compatible of oxides as a resistance switching material. It exhibits a variety of responses—both intrinsic and extrinsic—to electrical stress, which show significant promise for its use in a variety of technologies, from nonvolatile memories to neuromorphic devices and systems. Compared to other competing technologies, it offers higher stability, greater resistance contrast, ease of process integration, and the potential to minimize the requirement for cell selector elements. While there remain some challenges ahead to fully realize SiOx-based ReRAM memory chips or neuromorphic systems, silicon oxide is rapidly emerging as one of, if not the most, suitable contenders in the race to exploit resistance-switching technologies.",21,
372,"We have demonstrated the formation and working of bilayer structures of binary oxides HfOx and ZrOx for use in resistance memory applications. It was observed that the tight switching distribution of the ZrOx /HfOx bilayer structure can control the rupture and recovery of filaments located at the tip of the localized filament by oxygen exchange through the interface between the ZrOx and HfOx layers. Furthermore, this device showed a high resistance ratio, high speed of switching, and good retention at 85 °C. Therefore, the ZrOx /HfOx bilayer structure shows considerable potential for practical application to high-performance nonvolatile memory devices.",21,

374,"In summary, the electrical properties of an OBD with an Al/Alq3/nanostructured MoO3/Alq3/p+-Si structure were studied. We showed that the bistability of the OBD is derived from the charge trapping effect of the MoO3 nanoclusterlike layer interposed between the Alq3 thin films. Conductance switching without NDR was observed in the I-V characteristics of the OBD, which differs from that of an OBD with a MoO3 nanoparticle layer. The electrical characteristics of OBDs using nanostructured MoO3 are largely affected by the surface morphology of a nanostructured MoO3 layer.",7,
375,"We have successfully observed the resistive switching behavior via an in situ TEM demonstrating that the switching behavior was related to the formation and rupture of conducting nanofilaments. Research addressing the VCM mechanism is rare due to the technical difficulties. The memristor based on anion migration enriched the knowledge about device optimization and filament kinetics. In the Au/Ta2O5 /Au systems, the formation of filament was analyzed by EDS and EELS, and the composition was determined to be nanoscale TaO2−x filaments. Further investigation is warranted if the conducting filaments consist of oxygen vacancies ordering or oxygen-deficient phases. Moreover, the switching behavior was elaborated in terms of filament dynamics. To extend the application of RRAM, a more thorough understanding of how to precisely control filament formation and rupture is an important topic. The influence on current density, structure defect, and vacuum condition were systematically studied. The shrunken anode caused the current concentration, localizing the formation of the filament. The defect boundary led to a faster accumulation of oxygen vacancies. In addition, the defect changed the switching domination between electron transport and V_os migration. The switching behavior in vacuum conditions indicated that the backfill of oxygen significantly affected the RESET operation. We provided insights into the switching mechanism of VCM-type devices. The migration of the oxygen vacancies limited the filament dynamics, indicating the crucial role played by oxygen defects.",43,
376,"The value of exploring new paradigms in computation cannot be overstated, as the challenges of moving “beyond CMOS” undoubtedly provide inspiration and motivation for the next generation of scientists and engineers. Likewise, elucidating the fundamental nature of intelligence remains a question for the ages in fields spanning all of human endeavor. Drawing on a historical perspective of seminal developments in computer science, complex systems theory and neuroscience, we have set out to propose a hardware based approach to neuromorphic computation that aims to harness the power of highly coupled, nonlinear systems. We feel that the perspectives and results described herein represent a potentially important link between the requirements for real-time, multi-sensory computation and ongoing advances in neuroscience through a readily addressable physical system with collective behaviors analogous to those currently observed in biological neural networks.",13,
377,"Research into applications of artificial neural networks toward biologically inspired computation has been greatly facilitated by modern developments in neuroscience. Recent findings have shown biological neural networks to operate in a persistent critical state, a feature commonly associated with the critical point of a second-order phase transition and power law scaling of internal system dynamics. Under such circumstances, the system correlation length diverges in both space and time, indicating that the influence of past events decays slowly and physically distinct points within the system are coupled regardless of the magnitude of separation. Spatio temporal correlations of this type have been shown to maximize memory, transmission of information, and adaptability within complex networks, such that each part of the system is communicating with every other part of the brain, for every time of its history. A class of critical systems emerge from coupled networks of nonlinear elements governed by threshold dynamics that relax quickly compared to a slower external driving force, an arrangement that allows these systems to settle into a range of correlated metastable states. This model is more than superficially reminiscent of our current understanding of neural dynamics, and has been employed in recent forms of advanced neural network research including, but not limited, to reservoir methods such as liquid state machines and echo state networks.",13,
378,"To our knowledge, the self-assembled atomic switch network described here represents a unique implementation of a purpose-built electronic device composed of coupled nonlinear elements that clearly demonstrates critical dynamics. We propose that such a system provides a robust, flexible, and scalable experimental platform for controlled examinations of criticality and its potential applicability in the fields of neuroscience and neuromorphic computation. Further, the inherent properties of single atomic switches and emergent behaviors observed in these complex atomic switch networks indicate a capacity for memory and learning via temporally correlated, metastable critical states. Such an approach has potential utility for real-time, reservoir computation of multi-domain data systems such as those used in autonomous locomotion, proximity sensing and global positioning as well as a wide variety of sensing applications. Technological trends toward the growth of multidomain and distributed sensing systems represent the seminal challenge for new forms of emerging computation in the centenary of Turing’s birth.",13,
379,"In conclusion, we show that the RS behavior in memristors can be systematically tuned at the atomic level through doping. Speciﬁcally, Si doping can cause faster VO drift and improves the RS characteristics and leads to more controllable analog switching behavior. A measurement methodology was developed to extract the hopping distance and the depleted gap length during VO migration. The experimental ﬁndings were supported by ab initio calculations. We believe these results not only produce a desired memristor system that can be directly used in neuromorphic computing applications but also provide guidance for continued design and optimization of this important class of devices.",8,
380,"In summary, we demonstrated that the Al/p-a-Si/Al thin film device exhibits low operating voltage (~1 V), high endurance, and data retention (>10^5 s). With a quantitative analysis of FIB-SEM images and EDS depth profiling, we confirmed that the conducting filament is created by migration or diffusion of top metal after electroforming and is associated with nonvolatile resistive switching. These capabilities make the Al/p-a-Si/Al thin film device potentially usable as a future non-volatile memory application.",11,
381,"In summary, electric field-induced magnetic switching, accompanied by resistive switching, was observed in a series of Mn:ZnO films with thicknesses between 30 and 70 nm. The saturation magnetism of the films in the low resistance state was about five times larger than that in the initial state. The strong ferromagnetism of the film could be maintained for more than 2 days under ambient conditions. We suggest that the formation of conductive filaments based on oxygen vacancies under a positive electric field results in strong ferromagnetism due to a dramatic increase in the number of the bound magnetic polarons. Our work provides an effective and simple way to increase the ferromagnetism of dilute magnetic oxide films using an external electric field.",-1,
382,"In summary, a repetitive unipolar resistive switching of the memory with the Ru anode was fabricated. The carrier injection in the devices at HRS is governed by the direct tunneling at low bias and the FN tunneling at high bias. The direct tunneling in the device after the reset process suggests that a thin potential barrier layer is recovered at the region near the Ru anode. The variation in the oxygen concentration at the Ru/HfOx interface during the switching cycles may be responsible for the unstable barrier height at the anodic Ru/HfOx interface and wide Vset dispersion. For the realization of the Ru/HfOx /TiN resistive memory, the oxidation and reduction behaviors of oxygen atoms in HfOx in the proximity of the anodic interface should be well controlled.",5,
383,"The transition from nonvolatile to volatile behavior is governed by the balance between transport of Cu atoms and ions. The magnitude of Cu atom flux is impacted by the existence and thickness of the Cu δ-layer. For compliance current below 100 μA, a single ON-state resistance Ron characterizes the I-V curves. For high compliance current, the I-V characteristics are characterized by two ON resistance states Ron,1 and Ron,2. Ron,1 corresponds to the Ron for volatile resistive switching under low compliance currents. The Ron,2 resistance characterizes the I-V behavior after the bridge is formed at Vset and is operated at voltages beyond Vset. During the negative voltage sweep back to zero, the Ron,2 curve is retraced up to a voltage Vtrans< Vset, where the curve changes the slope in a narrow voltage interval to a slope characterized by Ron,1. Transition from volatile to nonvolatile switching can be effectuated by imposition of a high enough compliance current. The volatile cells are characterized by a retention time smaller than 0.5 s as dictated by the voltage sweep rate, whereas the retention for nonvolatile devices is at least 10^6 s. The volatile resistive switching device enables very compact realization of volatile and nonvolatile RRAM in the same device including switching between the two modes of operation and opens areas of applications in logic circuits, memristive and chaotic circuits, and neural networks. Since the I–V characteristic of a volatile resistive switch resembles I–V characteristic of a diode, a cross point array of nonvolatile and volatile switches enables not only the functionality of nonvolatile memory but also of the diode-based logic analogous to diode-transistor logic.8 Thus, both memory and logic functions can be realized by the same type of resistive device removing the constraint of manufacturing these devices on silicon substrates.",19,
384,"To summarize, by employing temperature-dependent electrical measurements, semiclassical charge transport models, DFT calculations, and C-AFM studies, we provide signiﬁcant insights into the resistive memory behavior in metal/monolayer TMD/metal structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the thinnest device demonstrating multilevel memory operation, thus setting the stage for ultrascaled two-terminal memories for digital and neuromorphic applications. The results obtained in our work are benchmarked against other atomically thin memristive devices published in the literature [Table S1]. The devices show unipolar thermochemical-based switching, where the reset process requires signiﬁcant Joule heating. We reveal that the transport in these devices changes from a combination of DT and FN tunneling in the IS to metallic ﬁlamentary in LRS to TAT in the HRS. DFT calculations and temperature-dependent measurements indicate that sulfur vacancies are reasonable candidates to explain the microscopic origin of trap sites. The multistates can hence be programmed by tuning the sulfur vacancy concentration using electric ﬁeld at room temperature. Finally, the creation and annihilation of multiﬁlamentary behavior can be observed using C-AFM measurements.",28,
385,"In conclusion, we reported a 1T1R cell where a TFT controls a bipolar resistive switching device. We studied the use of TFTs driving current in both directions. We also tested the effect of swapping the terminals of the RS device and discussed its implications regarding power requirements. A practical pulsing protocol to operate in a logic circuit was defined. The target of our work is the development and implementation of a building block that can ease the introduction of RS devices in large-area electronic circuits. It is useful in the cases where conventional single-crystal Si transistors cannot be used.",0,
386,"In summary, we designed a new memristor-integrated supercapacitor system with voltage-stabilizing features. The supercapacitor used in the system was fabricated by the nanoimprint lithography process with the features of excellent cycle life, enhanced capacitance, and outstanding electrical stability under bending. Integrating the supercapacitor with a SnO 2 - based memristor, the final integrated system delivered obvious voltage-stabilizing effects as confirmed from both the circuit analyses and the display demonstration. Our work demonstrates the successful integration between the two basic circuit elements (capacitor and memristor) to fulfill new functions. By design of flexible memristor and reducing the size of both the memristor and the supercapacitor, the fully flexible memristor supercapacitor may find real applications in current micro/nanoelectronics fields.",76,
387,"In conclusion, despite a lack of understanding of its physical origin in the past 50 years since its discovery, the unique threshold-switching phenomenon observed in Se- and Te-based amorphous chalcogenides upon electrical field application has nevertheless led recently to a major technological breakthrough in the memories field. The latter enabled the advent of high-density 3D nonvolatile resistive memories because of the association of a PCM element and an OTS selector, both based on chalcogenide materials. In that context, we have shown that tailoring the amorphous structure of GS-based thin films by N and Sb incorporation produces highly performant OTS materials, as demonstrated in selector devices. Because of the investigation of amorphous structure of prototypical chalcogenide thin films coupled with analysis of their electronic properties and their OTS behavior upon electric field application, we made it possible to draw design rules to optimize further the OTS properties of amorphous chalcogenides. First, controlling the number of homopolar and wrong bonds is demonstrated to be a key parameter to control subthreshold leakage current, which is the main limitation toward an increase in crossbar array sizes in 3D memory devices, whereas controlling the bandgap of the material permits to adjust the value of the threshold voltage. Moreover, increasing the rigidity of the amorphous structure by introducing covalently bonded element such as N atoms improves the amorphous phase stability against crystallization and therefore the endurance of the OTS selector.",61,
388,"While subthreshold conduction mechanisms in CGs are now well understood with more and more accurate models to describe experimental observations, the underlying physical mechanism at play during the OTS is still highly debated. Using AIMD simulations validated by all the above experimental investigations, we have been able to relate the OTS mechanism to subtle structural rearrangements of the amorphous phase upon high electric field application. The simulated electronic excitation of the glasses results in structural reordering, with bond alignment and appearance of local structural motifs reminiscent of the MVB that has been recently described in crystalline chalcogenide phase-change materials. The latter are therefore responsible for a huge change of electronic DoS accompanied by a huge increase in electronic conductivity of the materials.",63,
389,"In addition, the present OTS model tends to establish for the first time the common link between chalcogenide materials belonging to phase-change materials and those from the OTS family. In both systems, the MVB mechanism is at the origin of the unique properties that led to the recent breakthrough in nonvolatile memory field because of the coupling of a PCM-resistive cell and of an OTS selector. As evidenced here, the main difference between phase-change materials and OTS materials can be found in their ability to stabilize the MVB mechanism and in the energy barrier to crystallization.",61,
390,"Observing in situ the structural features of OTS switching remains a challenge. First, the limited volume of OTS material within the device requires the use of characterization techniques, which can probe areas as small as a few tens of square nanometers. Moreover, because of the use of high electrical fields, the OTS has to be triggered by electrical pulses of a few tens of nanoseconds, therefore limiting the in situ analysis to time-resolved experiments with nanosecond resolution. Nevertheless, the recent development of ultrahigh brilliance and time-resolved sources such as x-ray free electron lasers may give us the opportunity in the near future to measure the structural changes accompanying OTS by time-resolved nanoprobes. In a very recent study, a similar approach has been successfully used to evidence, for the first time, a liquid-liquid phase transition in phase-change materials by femtosecond diffraction.",63,
391,"The present experimental and simulation findings could be used to design chalcogenide materials with improved properties for applications exploiting their unique nonlinear behavior under an electric field. For instance, the unique nonlinear behavior under optical or electrical excitation could lead to the development of performant new neuromorphic devices to mimic signal processing of biological neurons beyond von Neumann computing schemes.",-1,
392,"In summary, we have studied the set statistical distributions of the Cu/HfO2/Pt CBRAM device. The Weibull slopes of the set voltage and current increase and decrease logarithmically with the off resistance, respectively, in the experiment. Monte Carlo simulation for Vset and Iset distributions based on the cell-based set voltage statistics model and the QPC model verified the experiment results. Therefore, our study on the set statistics reveals the physical nature behind the resistive switching statistics and provides inspiration on the reduction of the switching parameters variation.",5,
393,"In conclusion, a reduction of the LRS current is discov- ered in a V:SiO2/Si bi-layer structure after the addition of an inserted Si layer. The Pt/V:SiO2/TiN stack structure is fabricated as standard device. Due to the operation polarity, the oxygen ions generated among the set process are driven toward the Si/TiN terminal. Subsequently, the inserted Si layer is oxidized and forms a SiO2 barrier layer. As a result, the LRS current can be suppressed since the dominated con- duction mechanism transfers from Poole-Frenkel emission to Schottky emission. In addition, the current is limited and shows self-compliance behavior owing to the formation of this SiO2 barrier layer. Due to this self-compliance behavior which was obtained by the insertion of a Si layer, any addi- tional devices that are usually required to attain current com- pliance to protect the device from hard breakdown for an array application would therefore not be necessary.",25,
394,"In summary, we have demonstrated that memristors operated by spin-polarized electrodes (MEMs), can operate as a universal logic gate built on one single passive device. A direct proof of concept was demonstrated by the experimental realization of the universal “IMP” and “AND” logic gates, depending on the adopted bit coding. MEMs are fully compatible with the simple cross-bar geometry, typical of 2-terminal devices, and exploit all of its technological advantages. At the same time, the device properties are considerably enriched by using the magnetic field as a non-contact third terminal. The ability of a MEM to feature a large (nearly continuous) number of magnetically modulated memristances allows us to vary the logic-gate threshold value in a wide interval, making the device adaptable towards integration into logic circuits. Moreover, promising high memory capability (32 states and hence 5-bit storage) promotes the utilization of MEMs in memory applications.",8,
395,"The development of the MEM follows the strategy of integrating different functionalities into the same device, rather than increasing the density of the fundamental components of integrated circuits.",53,

The reproducible RS performance including uniform switching voltages, good endurance, and long retention properties has been demonstrated in Pt/CoFe2O4/Pt memory devices. Ohmic conduction in LRS and Schottky emission and Poole-Frenkel emission in HRS and resistance-temperature dependence of low and high resistance states indicate that the RS mechanism might be the formation and rupture of oxygen vacancies related filaments. Our results also suggest that cobalt ferrite thin films can find opportunities in resistive switching memory applications.",19,

399,"In summary, we have shown the transformation of polycrystalline to amorphous TiO2 layers by 50 keV Arþion beam irradiation at RT in the fluence range of (0.05–5) 1016 ions/cm2 with the help of GIXRD. The formation of isolated conducting regions surrounded by insulating mounts is revealed in c-AFM. Detailed TEM investigations, however, suggest the evolution of nano-channels with gradient OVs below the mounts and surrounded by voids. This is also consistent with the XPS results, showing an increase of TiO/Ti2O3 phase near the surface as a function of ion fluence, which reaches its maximum at 5 1016 ions/cm2 . Using c-AFM, local I-V measurements from the nanochannels have shown the evolution of RS loops with two distinct low and high resistance states that become prominent with increasing fluence. Moreover, the existence of non-zero crossing potential (Vc) at lower fluences is attributed to the influence of both resistive and inductive effects, FIG. 5. (a) Local I-V characteristics of S1 (open circles), S3 (open squares), and S5 (open diamonds) by sweeping the applied potential across the AFM tip and Pt back electrode from 2 V to þ2 V and back to 2 V with compliance current (Ic) 10 nA; (b) corresponding semi-log plots in (a) indicating gradual evolution of RS window with increasing fluence.

J. Appl. Phys. 118, 224903 (2015) while Vc shifts towards zero potential at higher fluences has been assigned to the increase in capacitive contribution. This is justified by fabricating two-terminal Pt/TiO2/Pt/Ti/ SiO2/Si memory devices, followed by monitoring the I-V characteristics at RT. Detailed analyses suggest that the observed RS behavior can be discussed in the light of OV migration through the self-organized nano-channels. We believe that the present work will bring opportunities to develop high density nano-channel based RS devices, but it requires further optimization of the voids dimension and/or distribution for practical application.",35,
400,"In summary, we propose a novel hybrid neuromorphic system comprising MAM devices with nonideal characteristics to efficiently implement on-the-fly learning when processing spike signals. This system is shown to overcome several important challenges that are characteristic to traditional memristive devices proposed for neuromorphic circuits, such as the asymmetric conductance response, limitations in resolution and dynamic range, as well as device-level variability (34). The analog circuit-based STDP design also has the features of efficient transistor cost, low power consumption, and intrinsic tolerance for process variations (35). Hence, the proposed system and the corresponding simulations are an important tool toward the realization of highly efficient, large-scale neuronal networks based on advanced nanodevices with typical experimentally observed nonideal characteristics. Our results could also benefit applications such as neuromorphic robots, context understanding, and video processing",39,
401,"In conclusion, the voltage control of MCE has been investigated in an LSMO/CeO2/Pt device. By applying low voltage, the resistance state of this device can be switched between HRS and LRS, which leads to remarkable changes of Ms and Tc in the LSMO film. Taking advantage of this feature, nonvolatile control of magnetocaloric operating temperature is realized in this device by low voltage. Moreover, this manipulation effect has good repeatability and reliability. All of these results not only provide an effective method to extend the magnetic refrigeration operating temperature region but also are available for designing next-generation voltage-tunable spintronic devices.",20,
402,"In summary, we propose the concept of two-mode (low SS and quasi-0D contact) ﬁlament MoS2 transistor. By comprehensively utilizing the MoS2 transistor compact model, contact resistance transmission line model, and CBRAM compact model to build and simulate I−V behaviors of the proposed transistor, the theoretical extremely low SS (down to 1.09 mV/ dec) in mode I and contact improvement by quasi-0D structure (∼56×) in mode II can be well predicted. In experiment, the devices are able to be fabricated in a large scale and show extremely low SS as 2.26 mV/dec in mode I and recorded high on/oﬀ ratio over 2.6 × 109 in mode II, which can well verify the proposed two-mode ﬁlament MoS2 transistor concept and performance prediction from the simulation. Over 50 times contact improvement is achieved.

403,"In this Article, an electric-field-induced reversible transition from the semiconducting 2H to a higher conducting 2Hd phase in vertical MoTe2 and Mo1–xWxTe2 RRAM devices has been achieved. Crosssectional STEM confirmed that the 2Hd state is formed after a set voltage is applied and that this structure can be described as a transient state between the semiconducting 2H and the metallic 1T′ or Td phase. Temperature-dependent electrical measurements indicate that the 2Hd state can exhibit semiconducting to metallic behaviour depending on the status of the transient state. Td and 2H co-existing phases in MoTe2 were observed at room temperature. Our work demonstates the possibility to locally and selectively engineer phase transitions in TMD layers with an electric field, and demonstrates the potential of TMDs for these types of resistive switching applications.",20,
404,"In summary, the resistive switching effect in CuOx NW synthesized by a low-cost and large-scale electrochemical process with AAO nanotemplates at low temperatures was successfully demonstrated. The CuOx NW memory devices exhibit a forming-free property, low electric-field-induced switching operation because of a significant amount of defects and Cu nanocrystals in the CuOx nanowires. Detailed resistive switching mechanisms are systematically proposed and investigated. This work is expected to have not only have the opportunity to help in the exploration of forming-free resistive switching mechanisms but also the potential to improve performance for resistive memory devices.",9,
405,"In summary, we have exhibited the unipolar and the bipolar switching at NiO thin films deposited on Pt and SRO bottom electrodes, respectively. Through I-V and C-V measurements, it is found that unipolar switching is related with changes in bulk-limited filamentary conduction. On the other hand, bipolar switching is described as interfacial Schottky barrier changes.",27,
406,"We have shown that the Pt/δ-Bi2O3/Au cell undergoes unipolar resistance switching. Because the low and high resistance states that are formed are persistent, this cell is a candidate for future RRAM devices. The voltage difference between the LRS and HRS is over 1 V, and the resistance contrast between the two states is over 106. Our results are consistent with the formation and rupture of a conducting filament of Bi metal. The effective diameter of the Bi filaments is in the 140-260 nm range and can be controlled by varying the compliance current used to SET the cell. The gap that is formed after resetting the cell is estimated to be 50 nm in length, and is independent of the compliance current. The Bi nanowires in the low resistance state are superconducting, with a Tc of 5.8 K, and an Hc of 5 kOe. A very large applied electric field of 40 MV/m reduces δ-Bi2O3 to Bi filaments in the FORMING step, and a large applied current density of 2.2 ( 0.2 x 107 A/cm2 ruptures the Bi filaments during the RESET step. The current density necessary to effect filament rupture is independent of the filament diameter. Joule heating and/or current-driven electromigration are possible mechanisms for the rupture of the Bi nanofilaments. Because the electrodeposition method we use to deposit the δ-Bi2O3 is not a line-of-sight deposition method like sputtering and the material only deposits on electrified interfaces, it should be possible in future work to deposit the material conformally onto crossbar arrays to produce highly scalable memory.",44,
407,Resistively switching memory elements are a promising candidate for their use in future generation non-volatile memory devices.

408,"4. Conclusions and Perspectives Programmable and erasable nonvolatile data-storage media are vital for portable electronics and Internet of Things. However, scaling down of memory size presents challenges. The develop­ ment of molecular memory with well-characterized chargestorage properties is the main motivation for constructing high-density nonvolatile memories with miniaturized size. The molecules designed in a lucid way with adjustable electrical characteristics can be integrated into CMOS devices through existing fabrication techniques. POM molecules are a promi­ sing candidate for storage nodes toward molecular electronic applications. First, POMs can reversibly trap and detrap a large number of electrons under minimal structural reorganization. Second, POMs exhibit several discrete redox states within a constricted potential range, indicating the capability of giving access to multibit data storage. Finally, the reorganization of the limited structures during redox processes, as well as the delocalization of electrons over the POM skeleton, can lead to long-term stability of the programming/erasing cycles.",67,
409,"Recent years have witnessed a considerable evolution in the rational design and synthesis of POM molecules, along with an increasing number of publications discussing their potential applications in nonvolatile memories and other electronic devices. To compete with various types of mate­ rials, including quantum dots, polymers, small molecules, and 2D materials, the desirable electronic structure of POM films should be readily controlled through doping engi­ neering, in addition to overcoming challenges in practical applications including ambiguous mechanisms and intricate morphology control.",67,
410,"At this point, the reader should have an impression of the chemical and electrical properties of POM molecules and their applications in nonvolatile memory cells. Apart from memory applications, we can envisage that future innovations will fall into several areas such as electron- or hole-transport layers in photovoltaic devices, light-emitting diodes, and fuel cells. The relative energy levels of LUMO and HOMO correlated with electron affinity and ionization potential can be readily tuned by utilizing ions with different electronegativity levels for sub­ stituting Mn+ ions or transforming POM molecules between Keggin type and Dawson type. The enhanced charge-carrier injection/extraction efficiency and reduced electron–hole recombination rate, resulting from a decrease in the chargecarrier injection/extraction barriers can significantly improve the device performance by incorporating the POM film at the interface between the active layer and cathode/anode. Sensors and reversible multielectron redox processes of POMs stimu­ late interests for detecting redox-active agricultural and indus­ trial pollutants including nitrates, chlorates, bromates, and hydrogen peroxide. A thin-film transistor architecture with anchored or immobilized POMs as receptors can reach low detection limits. The energy storage and reversible multilevel redox behavior of POMs can also be exploited for recharge­ able batteries. Lithium batteries employing [PMo12O40]3− and [PW12O40]3− POM molecules as cathode-active materials exhibit large capacities. POMs should be very stable during solid-state electrochemical redox variation. The high chemical stability and tunability accompanied by the intrinsic electron-storage capacity make POMs ideal candidates for supercapacitors. Using POMs and other conductive nanomaterials as anodes of supercapacitors and maximizing the interactions between them allow improved charge transfer.",67,
411,"In summary, we discuss a variety of electronic applications of POM molecules. The multielectron redox behavior, high chemical stability and tunability, and the ability to downscale devices to the nanoscale level are impressive figures of merit. Special attention must be focused on the integration of POMs into electronic and particularly memory devices. POMs can be used in a wide range of fields from chemistry to catalysis and from memory devices to energy-storage devices.",67,
412,"In summary, we have proposed a TiN/Si:HfO2/ OD-HfO2/TiN memory device that may greatly enhance the resistance ratio by employing ferroelectric modulation to barrier. The greatly enhanced resistance ratio is ascribed to the creation/elimination of an extra barrier in OD-HfO2 layer in response to the polarization reversal in the ferroelectric Si:HfO2 layer. The long retention and good endurance make the proposed device a promising candidate for non-volatile resistive memories. The defect energy levels within the band gap, determined by the oxygen vacancy concentration, were responsible for determining the barrier height. The resistance modulation due to ferroelectricity of HfO2 is under further investigation.",62,
413,"In summary, a 2-D finite element model is used to model the time dependent evolution of current-induced filaments in nc-Si wires. The electro-thermal transport in nc-Si wires under high amplitude, nanosecond voltage pulses is simulated using temperature dependent material parameters. Extrapolated thin film resistivity data for simulated nc-Si wires suggest that thin film resistivity of nanocrystalline materials decreases orders of magnitude as fill factors approach unity. During simulated pulses across suspended and on-SiO2 nc-Si wires, multiple percolation paths collapse onto a single, molten filament, which confines current densities greater than 100 MA/cm2 to 10%–30% of the width of the wires. Modeling percolation transport and filament formation in nanocrystalline materials or nanocomposites is important for understanding electro-thermal processes at nanometer scale. Electro-thermal modeling at small scales is critical for further development of novel nanoelectronic components, such as nonvolatile phase-change memory (PCM),13 resistance-switching memory (RRAM),14,15 and programmable metallization cell memory (PMC).1",54,
414,"In summary, we explore the low frequency noise sources verse frequency for the TiOx/TiOy cell before and after elec- troforming steps to verify the conduction features induced by the evolution of bias-dependent conduction filaments. The lower 1/f noise at LRS is primarily related to the formation of conductive filaments, while the higher 1/f noise at HRS is attributable to the distinct combination factors of the top resistive layer and oxygen-driven redox reaction at the oxide interfaces. Therefore, we expect that the fundamental nature of resistive switching behaviors may rely on the movements of oxygen ions or vacancies under bias",57,
415,"In summary, the resistive switching behavior in our Pt/ SiO0.73/Pt devices has been investigated. The devices operate at lower voltage regime (<2.0 V). The reset voltage ( 0.7 V) is lower than set voltage ( 1.7 V) and the performance is reduced in the vacuum environment. The characteristics are different from that reported by either Yao or Mehonic. The reason may be due to the different oxygen content x and the bonding configurations. In our samples, the x is less than 0.75 and the concentration of pre-existed Si-DBs is higher than 1.0 1019 cm3 . Based on these results, we proposed the Si-DBs percolation model to explain the resistive switching behavior of silicon highly rich SiO0.73 based devices. The three experimental evidences support our model which may help to go deep understanding of the resistive switching mechanism of silicon oxide materials.",-1,
416,"In conclusion, low-temperature phases in LPCMO with enormously different resistance values _x0001_differing by _x0006_105 can be repeatedly switched by applying voltage pulse. In addition, the resistance value of each phase is highly repeatable through cycling and also stable with time. These behaviors are associated with the intriguing hysteresis in the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases shown in the V-T phase diagram, and can be utilized for cryogenic memory applications, which can facilitate low-T electronics technologies. We also found that phases with intermediate resistance values can be repeatedly induced and switched back to an insulating or metallic phase by applying appropriate voltage pulses, which can be exploited for multilevel memory devices. For future applications, optimization of, e.g., chemical composition and sample architecture shall be required to maximize the phase switching speed and phase stability",0,
417,"In conclusion, we have successfully introduced a new ultrananocrystalline TiO_x material for fabricating low-bias activated Pt/TiO_x/Pt (single-active-layer) memristive devices. Combined with the ultrananocrystalline nature (with an average crystallite size below 5 nm), the built-in oxygen vacancies in the defect-rich TiO_x matrix are found to be responsible for the electric field localization that enables oxygen vacancy trapping at discrete grain locations. This makes possible activation of the memory element at a much lower activation voltage (+1.5 V), with the SET voltage as low as +0.59 V, than those reported in the literature. Our bipolar devices follow the interface-type switching mechanism, consistent with the observed proportional current dependency on the junction size. High endurance for a large number of repeated cycles and high retention capacity of the device provide an estimated device lifetime of well over 10 years. Along with the low operating voltages and the resulting low power consumption advantage, the short-term and long-term potentiation at much smaller READ voltages makes these devices potentially suitable for neuromorphic systems. The simple, completely room-temperature fabrication procedure for these high-performance memristive devices promises low-cost, scalable manufacturing of the next-generation ReRAM devices that can be easily integrable into a 3D stacking device architecture.",28,
418,"In summary, we discover the transition phenomenon of two kinds of different resistive switching behaviors in SiOx based Pt/SiOx/Pt devices with different x component. Based on the transition information of the microstructures such as the Si-O bonds configurations and the related Si-DBs from the “normal unipolar region” to “abnormal unipolar region” and the hopping conductance characteristics of LRS in both two regions, we may use the electric field induced Si-DBs percolation model to explain the x dependent transition phenomenon of resistive switching behaviors.",-1,

The AlOy layer at the ZnO/Al interface works as the trapping sites for holes and play a key role in PPC and the resistive switching. The present optoelectronic device with multifunctions has a very promising prospective in the applications of multidimensional neural networks, biological brain simulations and high-performance information storage and computing.",3,
420,"In summary, we explore the charge conduction and resistive switching of Pt/BFO/SRO, which strongly depends on the intrinsic defects (i.e., cation vacancy and oxygen va- cancy) in BFO. Both switchable diode effect in Bi-deficient BFO and bipolar resistive switching in Bi-rich BFO can be explained by not only ferroelectric-polarization-reversal but also defect ion migration. From the different charge conduc- tion and resistive switching behaviors observed in Bi (1.00) and Bi (1.10) capacitors, we can argue that the intrinsic defect in BFO strongly affects interfacial state and/or bar- riers formed in Pt/BFO/SRO. Our results will advance the understanding of a role of the intrinsic defects in controlling the interface of metal/ferroelectric/metal capacitor structures applicable to resistive switching memory nanodevices.",17,
421,"In conclusion, ambient gas effects on resistive switching behaviors in the simple TaN/SiO2/nþþ Si-substrate structure were investigated. Electroforming voltage in N2 ambient is larger than in vacuum but no degradation of resistive switching is observed. Possible N-incorporated into the active switching region by Joule heating may result in an increase of current at 0.2V.Moreover, the oxygen-induced switching failure mode is observed in detail by controlling the pressure of the nitrogen-oxygen mix.It is found that exposure to≥10 Torr 20% O2-N2 disables resistive switching, but normal switching behavior and can be recovered by applying a voltage sweep in vacuum.The statistical distribution of switching behaviors and failure modes were investigated using bi-modal Monte Carlo simulations, which establishes the oxygen detection levels for oxygen sensor developmentand the packaging requirements for SiOx-based ReRAM for use in future applications.",25,
422,"The carrier transport mechanism of Schottky contacts on Al=PI=TaN ReRAMs with rubbing post-treatment is investigated. The devices can achieve extremely low power consumption by the rubbing technique. After RP, the molecular chains close to the interface, which were initially arranged randomly, showed a more regular and unidirectional arrangement, resulting in the decrease in nonideal generation current in the HRS and the decrease in conductivity in the LRS. Therefore, the reverse leakage current is reduced by one order of magnitude and the distribution is decreased by two orders of magnitude. Experimental data show that the ultralow power consumption of PI-based ReRAM can be achieved and a high ION=IOFF current ratio of over seven orders of magnitude can be maintained by preparing PI films with RP. In addition, good retention capability under 85 °C was shown with an attractive high ION=IOFF ratio of 2.56 × 107",-1,
423,"Summarizing, based on oxygen engineered TaOx thin films with tunable bandgap and density, we have studied the influence of the oxygen contents on the RS behavior. High oxygen deficiency leads to a complex mixture of multiple oxidation states of Ta as confirmed by photoelectron spec- troscopy. The forming voltage can be tuned in a large range according to the chosen amount of oxygen deficiency. A thin oxidized surface layer was sufficient to contribute to electro- forming. In addition to a stable bipolar RS, unipolar and threshold RS were found to coexist in the PTTT devices at higher oxygen contents. While the low resistance state dis- played ohmic behavior, in the high resistance state, the current-voltage characteristics could be described by a trap controlled space charge limited conduction model with the oxygen vacancies acting as trap sites. These clear evidences of the dependence of multiple switching regimes on the oxygen stoichiometry are significant to a better understand- ing for future design of RRAM devices with appropriate functionality.",10,
424,"In this study we have clearly demonstrated by electromotive force measurements that nonequilibrium states are generated by operating ReRAM cells. Without a counter charge/reaction, which is inevitably required to enable anodic oxidation, no resistive switching takes place. Moisture supplying this counter charge/reaction is playing an important role during the electrochemical oxidation of Cu ions, being responsible for the filament formation and, therefore, for resistance transition in SiO2-based ReRAM cells. The origin of the electromotive force and the impact of pH2O are attributed to a diffusion potential modulated by the electrochemical half-cell reactions (Nernst potential) at the Cu/SiO2 and SiO2/Pt interfaces. The understanding of these effects leads to a new interpretation of the factors controlling the switching behavior in SiO2-based ECM cells.",-1,

427,"In this paper, HfOx-based RRAM devices with TiN/ HfOx (6 nm)/TiN (device A), TiN/Ti/HfOx (6 nm)/TiN (device B), TiN/Ti/AlOx (1 nm)/HfOx (6 nm)/TiN (device C), and TiN/Ti/AlOx (2 nm)/HfOx (6 nm)/TiN (device D) stack layers were fabricated. The impact of the AlOx layer on the resistive switching characteristics and device-to-device uniformity was measured and investigated. Owing to the high oxygen scavenging ability of the Ti metal, the number of oxygen vacancies in dielectric films increased and oxygen ions tended to accumulate in the Ti interposing layer. On the other hand, because of the material property difference between AlOx and HfOx and the high local electric field at the interface of two dielectric films, the formation locations of CFs would be confined during the forming process. As a result, device B exhibited improved device-to-device uniformity and lower VForming, VSet, and VReset than device A because of the Ti interposing layer. Moreover, by adopting the optimization of thickness of bilayered dielectric films, which were 1-nm-thick AlOx and 6-nm-thick HfOx, the further improved device-to-device uniformity of device C could be achieved. Nevertheless, owing to the additional AlOx layer, the operation voltages of device C would become slightly larger than those of device B. There would be tradeoff between the operation voltages and the device-to-device uniformity by the introduction of bilayered dielectric films. As for device D, it not only did not exhibit better uniformity than device C as expected but also showed worse uniformity than device B. This was attributed to the increased oxygen atomic percentage in bilayered 2-nm-thick AlOx and 6-nmthick HfOx dielectric films, reflecting that there would be less oxygen vacancies to form CFs. Thus, the appropriate thickness of bilayered dielectric films was very important to improve the operation issues of RRAM devices.",1,
428,"In conclusion, we have shown that single crystalline GaN nanomembranes arranged in simple networks consisting of parallel memristors are able to perform basic learning mechanisms such as habituation, dishabituation, and to memorize the learned responses to various electrical stimuli. As the number of memristors connected in parallel increases, the learning processes are faster, i.e., occur after a smaller number of sweeps, which can be considered similar to the voltage drop on synapses during long-term potentiation. In addition, the asymmetry of the temporal response at positive and negative step voltage excitations decreases significantly as the number of parallel GaN membranes increases, while the average time for reaching the steady state remains almost the same. The physics of memristors, i.e., the progressive occupation of surface states as a result of the migration of trapped negative charges under the influence of a trap-induced electric-field, is responsible for the analog learning mechanisms of habituation and dishabituation.",3,
429,"In conclusion, the effect of the BCZT layer thickness on the ferroelectric and resistive switching characteristics of Pt/ BCZT/HAO/Au was evaluated. It was shown that the remnant polarization and coercive fields are decreasing functions with the BCZT thickness in the Pt/BCZT/HAO/Au structures. Moreover, the RS behavior is understood as it strictly depends on the barrier variation at the BCZT/HAO interface caused by the polarization flipping. Moreover, it was also shown that the switching field can be adjusted by controlling the thickness of the BCZT layer. This is an important feature which can be seen as a first step into the next generation of RS based devices to operate with low power consumption and a high RS ratio.",17,
430,"In summary, RS is introduced to the post-treatment of solar cell devices, which can effectively improve the photovoltaic performance by setting the device to a low resistance state under certain electric fields. The mechanism has been ascribed to the decreased defect density in bulk and band optimization at the interface during the defect migration in the RS process. This strategy is applied to BiFeO3-based photovoltaic devices, where J_sc increases 2.3 times from 2.38 to 5.66 μA/cm^2 at the maximum set voltage of 3.5V and V_oc increases 1.35 times from 0.39 to 0.525V at the maximum set voltage of 5V. However, further increasing the maximum set voltage will drastically decrease J_sc and V_oc, which is due to the higher defect density at the interface, leading to the drastic increase in electron–hole recombination. Our results suggest that RS is a promising strategy that can be applied on the fabricated solar cell devices to further improve the photovoltaic performances.",4,

For single-level cell (SLC) operation, excellent cycling endurance (up to 108 times), fast switching speed ( 2 ns), and low voltage (1.4 V) programming are demonstrated. For MLC operation, 2-bit/cell storage with more than 10000 cycling endurance and stable resistance readout over time are demonstrated. This new RTO WOx RRAM is promising for both high density storage and embedded memory applications.",71,
432,"By electrical and EA investigation in both air and vacuum, we have shown evidence that the resistance switching mechanism in ZnO nanoparticle memristors is the drift of oxygen vacancies under the external field, associated with the adsorption and desorption of oxygen molecules at the ZnO nanoparticle/Al interface. This interfacial layer effectively changes the workfunction of Al electrode and results in the modulation of the resistance state. We believe that our findings are important for future memristive device design and fabrication.",45,
433,"To summarize, a Ag/MAFC/Cu device was fabricated that exhibited nonvolatile bipolar resistive switching behavior at room temperature. No obvious degradation was found in both high and low resistance states in this device after 600 s and 400 voltage cycles. These results demonstrate that the Ag/MAFC/ Cu device was robust and retained its resistance state over long cycle periods. In addition, this device exhibited a uniform and reproducible resistive switching effect over a wide temperature range of 290 to 340 K. On the basis of a comparison of the oxidation states of the Ag and Cu electrodes before and after an electric event, XPS results suggest that oxidative insulating layers were formed at the metal electrode/MAFC interfaces. The change in the resistance state was due to the passivation or dissipation of oxidized layers at the interface of the metal electrodes and the MAFC. A model describing the oxidative reactions properly helped to elucidate the symmetric resistive switching behavior in the Ag/MAFC/Cu device. This interfacial effect enabled achievement of the write/read function of this memory cell. This work provided a novel approach for the exploration of potential future applications of this type of organic−inorganic material for electronic data storage information.",20,

435,"In this work, we synthesized single-crystalline CuO nanowires and fabricated a Au/Ti/CuO NW/Ti/Au RRAM nanodevice. The electrical measurement showed a stable switching behavior and outstanding low power consumption. The EDS mapping revealed that the migration of oxygen ions dominated the resistive switching behavior. In addition, the EELS analysis indicated that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies were generated during the forming process. Furthermore, the HRTEM images showed that a tiny conducting filament with a diameter below 4 nm was generated at the surface of the CuO nanowire. The CuO structure in the conducting region was transformed into Cu2O. The fitting of the I-V measurement revealed that the conducting mechanism of the CuO NW was SCLC at LRS. This result also demonstrated that the oxygen vacancies caused the resistive switching. Compared with micron-size CuO thin film RRAM devices, the diameter of the conducting filament was minimized by three orders of magnitude, implying the size of the filament can be reduced as the device is scaled down to the nanoscale. Because the resistive switching was controlled by generating and erasing the filament, the power consumption also decreased as the filament was miniaturized. This study was the first to analyze a single CuO nanowire and shows its potential in nanodevice applications. The results will push RRAM toward practical applications in next-generation nonvolatile memory.",9,
436,"The identification of the Magne´li phase as conducting filaments has important implications for the switching mechanism in RRAM. At the initial stage, a random oxygen vacancy will be created as the oxygen atoms are displaced from the bulk position by the external field and thermal effects. Above a critical density, oxygen vacancies will spontaneously rearrange to form an ordered structure. Indeed, first-principles calculations with the same computational set-up as in ref. 28 found that the Magne´li phase is more stable than the rutile phase with a uniform distribution of oxygen vacancy, by ~2 eV per Ti4O7 formula unit. Therefore, with increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies, there should be a strong thermodynamic driving force to form the Magne´li phase. The presence of a stable metallic phase explains the outstanding endurance of many RRAM devices, which is difficult to rationalize if the conducting paths comprise a random distribution of point defects. In this respect, it would be worth reexamining the conducting path in other oxides in terms of vacancy ordering or oxygen-deficient phases. A recent report on the valence reduction of a switching filament in CuO cells is, thus, very interesting. ",46,
437,"We demonstrated a simple and robust single-crystal perovskite sample, which showed EL at low temperatures and sufficiently high currents. The proposed sample concept where the electrode-perovskite structure stayed pristine throughout the process from fabrication to characterization allowed us to observe more regular current oscillation in single-crystal perovskites. We observed a novel oscillatory behavior, which relates to thermally activated process because of its Arrhenius dependency on the temperature. In addition, the MSM sample showed a regular quasi-periodic sharp rise in current, corresponding to intermittent EL, which can be explained by filament formation within the sample. These observations could shed new light on the intrinsic behaviors of singlecrystalline perovskite devices and highlight the significance of ionic motion on the conduction in perovskite devices, which is important for novel perovskite applications in future. Although alerting the use of perovskite single crystals in normal lighting or communications applications, we hope the future will determine some practical uses of this interesting mechanism. Some possible areas are in iontronics or in neuromorphic memory devices which can use the emission as an additional degree of freedom.",12,
438,"In summary, we have developed a unique approach to decouple electrical transport from thermal transport between two states by forming and disrupting CNFs within a thermoelectric film via electrochemical redox processes without additional fabrication process. The electrical to thermal conductivity ratio can be switched cyclically between two well-defined states by the formation/disruption of a high density of ≈10 nm metallic CNFs within the thin film. Additional key characteristics of the RS method are its simplicity and its applicability to classic thermoelectric materials. Our strategy is expected to broaden the research pathway for developing new switchable and high-performance thermoelectric nanocomposites.",-1,

The amorphous LCMO films were crystallized through rapid thermal annealing process at oxygen atmosphere. I-V curve and pulsed bias measurement indicated that stable I-V hysteresis and pulse-bias-induced resistance switching only took place in crystallized LCMO films. The coexistence of highconductive crystalline grains and low-conductive grain boundaries results in the inhomogenous conductivity in LCMO films. The resistance switching took place at the interface between the Ag electrode and crystalline grains and can be described as the electric field induced oxygen vacancy annihilation/generation combined with the change in electron/hole trap density. From these results, well resistance switching can be expected in the metal-oxide-metal sandwiches by the proper match of electrodes with good oxygen affinity and films with oxygen-sensitive and inhomogenous conductivity.",27,
440,"In summary, the resistive and magnetization switching can be simultaneously manipulated in Pt/Cr-NFO/Pt memory devices by the electric field during switching operations. The design devices exhibited typical unipolar switching with narrow operating voltages, good endurance, large ON/OFF ratio, and excellent retention. The stability and uniformity of switching parameters were attributed to the reduction in the randomness of conducting filaments formation/rupture by Cr-doping. The conduction mechanism in the high and low resistance states was demonstrated by Schottky emission and Ohmic conduction behaviors. Moreover, the devices showed controlling magnetic switching via the internal redox reaction and Joule heating effects during the RS process, corresponding to the reversible switching of HMS (OFF state) to LMS (ON state). The mechanisms of resistive and magnetization switching in the ferrite based device were closely linked with the formation and rupture of conducting filaments based on oxygen vacancies, valence change, redox reactions, and Joule heating effects. Our work provides us a promising approach to design multistate logic switching functionality devices.",20,
441,"In summary, we have demonstrated the POx/BP memristor array with reliable and reproducible resistive switching performance on an individual BP flake. The resistive switching behavior originates from the oxygen vacancy migration in the self-assembly grown phosphorous oxide layer. The POx/BP memristors reveal an ultrahigh average on/off ratio >10^7, data retention >10^4 s, and repeated programmable behavior. Furthermore, the POx/BP affords flexibility in nanoscale and high supervised online learning accuracy. The memristor shows high potential for next-generation wearable electronics and neuromorphic computing applications.",8,
442,"In summary, we have demonstrated that 20 nm-thick aLSMO thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering exhibit diode-like volatile RS properties under lower CC. The Ag/a-LSMO/Pt cell can exhibit stable volatile RS performances up to 100 I-V cycles with rectification ratio above 10^2 The retention time increases with the CC increasing, and the cell becomes nonvolatile when the CC reaches 1 mA because of the stronger Ag nanofilament. The C-AFM current mapping images confirm the instability of conducting nanofilaments forming under lower CC. The volatility of the cell depends strongly on the temperature as well as the Ag nanofilament dimension. The volatile RS behaviors could be explained by the Rayleigh instability of the Ag nanofilament, together with the diffusion of Ag atoms to the a-LSMO matrix. The synaptic diode-like volatile RS properties have considerable application potential in the fields of beyond von-Neumann computers.",-1,
443,"Arrays of memristors based on RS can be reproducibly manufactured on a large scale,[35,36] and they are currently on the path to commercialization. Off-the-shelf magnetic random-access memories based on MgO are already available. Thus, the memristive MTJ as a complete synapse-neuron system is believed to become the basis of future artificial neural networks. Two existing technologies must be brought together to fabricate such networks. The study of artificial networks can provide important insights into the functionality of biological networks and could also allow for new forms of computing. For example, neuromorphic circuits specialized for pattern recognition may support todays systems; the flexibility of the former would complement the speed of the latter. Alternatively, if an artificial neural network were trained to perform a specific task, the final result could be implemented with classical circuitry and then mass produced.",-1,
444,"In summary, we have shown that NDR observed in NbOx is due to self-heating via a bulk conduction mechanism that is well described by three-dimensional PooleFrenkel conduction modified by the presence of donors and traps. More generally, NDR can result from any conduction mechanism with a temperature and electric field dependence such that thermal runaway occurs at sustainable fields and temperatures. This presents additional options for creating Stype NDR devices for applications such as selectors in emerging non-volatile crossbar memory arrays. For instance, employing interface-limited conduction mechanisms such as Schottky emission allows tailoring of the characteristic activation energy, in this case the Schottky barrier height, over a broad range (see supplementary material for the equations governing NDR based on a self-heating Schottky emitter). Another advantage of self-heating based NDR is that it can occur at relatively low internal temperatures. Using the fitted value of Rth, we estimate the temperature at the NDR onset to be 380–400 K in our NbOx selectors, far lower than the 1080 K transition temperature of the IMT. This relatively low operating temperature affords power and durability advantages.",0,
445,"In conclusion, we estimated P_r and V_c after domain switching current transformation into a P-V hysteresis loop with pulse width as short as 30 ns. After deduction of the leaky current from the switching current, we extracted the P-V hysteresis loop in a leaky BFO thin film with domain switching mechanism different from other insulators. This technique is unique and superior to traditional Sawyer-Tower measurements for the nanosecond characterization of imprint and retention in either insulating or leaky thin films.",4,
446,"Finally, a metal-ferroelectric-metal tunneling junction structure with Ag nanoislands on top of ultrathin ferroelectric BTO film, have been fabricated by a system integrating a LMBE and a nanocluster beam generator. The introducing of Ag nanoislands on top of BTO film can result in apparent enhancements in both current density and symmetry in I-V hysteresis curves. The enlarged tunneling current can be ascribed to the reduction in barrier height as well as an increase in effective tunneling area by Ag electrode, while the improved current symmetry is likely due to the creation of flat electrode-oxide contact instead of point contact through the sharp protrusion of C-AFM tip.",4,
447,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated a concept about controlling the formation of conductive filaments by low-energy H+ irradiation. The H+ irradiated samples show good unipolar resistive switching behavior that is absent in the asdeposited samples. Moreover, the SrTiO3 samples irradiated by H+ ions at 120 KeV and 10^15/cm2 dose is superior as compared with the others, which exhibits an excellent resistive switching. Its compliance current can be reduced down to several micro-ampere level, and reset current is only 200 μA, making it useful for low power consumption applications. The low-energy H+ irradiation may be an effective method to optimize resistance switching memory performances.",2,
448,"In conclusion, we have investigated the charge carrier conduction and a resistance switching mechanism of the Ba doped ZnO NP based memristor. The electrical characterization of the device is successfully carried out based on the SCLC conduction model. Effective impurity doping of ZnO NPs gave rise to the generation of a high number of Vo. The Vo migration, inducing CF formation and dissolution, was found to be responsible for the resistance switching phenomenon observed in the ITO/Ba0.95ZnO1-xNP/Al memristor. Furthermore, the self-rectifying characteristic of the identiﬁed ITO/Ba0.95ZnO1-xNP/Al device is desirable for the construction of a high density advanced neu- romorphic systems. Additionally, the memristor asymmetry opens up another possibility of its practical application, namely, in the ﬁeld of secure signal transmission in a nonlinear form.",45,
449,"In conclusion, we show that ultrathin few-layer HfS2 can be incorporated into a variety of vdW heterostructures and selectively transformed into an amorphous high-k oxide using laser irradiation. In contrast to sputtering or ALD, the use of photo-oxidized HfS2 allows for clean interfaces without damaging the underlying 2D materials. We demonstrate that the laser-written HfOx has a dielectric constant k ~ 15 and a breakdown field of ~ 0.5 to 0.6 V/nm. These properties allow us to demonstrate several promising high-quality vdW heterostructure devices using this oxide : ReRAM elements that operate in the voltage limit of ~ 1 V ; flexible TMDC-FETs with Ion/Ioff > 10^4, subthreshold swings of 100 mV per decade, and good resilience to bending cycles ; and optoelectronic devices based on quantum well architectures, which can emit and detect light in the same device, with EL intensities and drive voltages comparable to devices with hBN barriers and photodetection response times up to 10^6 times faster than equivalent planar MoS2 devices. Moreover, the high-k dielectric constant, the compatibility with 2D materials, and the ease of laser-writing techniques will allow for significant scaling improvements and greater device functionality, which we predict to be an important feature for future flexible semi-transparent vdW nanoelectronics.",1,
450,"In this paper, we have demonstrated that incorporation of ultra-thin Al2O3–y buffer layers in TiO2–x active layers reduced switching voltages. The Al2O3–y layers acted in a rather homogeneous way and not as solid barriers inside the active layer. The switching voltages of the devices comprising Al2O3–y layers were +2.0/-2.0 V and +1.5/-1.5 V, which were tested with DC voltage sweeping and pulse sweeping, respectively. The Al2O3–y layers were suggested to have a double role, not only injecting excess oxygen vacancies but also enhancing a more repeatable and stable filament formation/eruption. Preliminary cycling endurance results suggested that Al2O3–y layers possibly enhanced the devices’ endurance, but more work on this matter has to be carried out to reveal the full potential of these devices in endurance. The non-volatile analog mode of switching of the devices is not limiting the devices’ potential but can make them good candidates for a variety of applications in neuromorphic computing.",43,
451,"In summary, a nonvolatile memory device based on a single graphene sheet suspended on a patterned ITO electrode pair was fabricated. The I–V curves for the single graphene sheet-based memory device exhibited electrical bistability with an ON/OFF ratio of 1 x 10^6 and excellent retention ability in ambient conditions. The observed switching effect is proposed to originate from the local oxidation of graphene sheet at the graphene/electrode interface. The recoverable electrical transition and good compatibility with conventional semiconductor technologies make the graphene-based device applicable in practical nonvolatile memories.",73,
452,"In conclusion, volatile and non-volatile resistive switching was demonstrated in single non-stoichiometric CuO-NW for low-cost selector and memory applications. The compliance current controls the stability of the hole-based conducting ﬁlament on the surface of NW, and volatile and non-volatile modes are determined by the mag-nitude of compliance current levels. The volatile threshold switching mode was operated with low compliance current, and the device exhibited bidirectional operation, high selectivity (10^4), low OFF-current (<100 pA), and stable reliability with the endurance over 10^5 cycles under the pulse operation. The device performances are attrib-uted to the nature of the surface conducting ﬁlaments on oxide-nanowire. Large uniformity of V_th was observed in the presented devi-ces, but will be improved by developing nano-scale devices.",9,
453,"The high-quality ZnCrTiO layers were grown on the Pt (111)/Ti/Al2O3 (0001) substrates. The ZnCrTiO layers (Ti ¼ 0–0.3 at. %) showed the enhanced disorder-activated Raman modes, attributing to lattice displacement-induced phonon scattering. The samples exhibited ferroelectric-like features, and the remnant polarization of ZnCrTiO (Ti ¼ 0.2–0.3 at%) was increased by a factor of ten, in comparison with ZnCrO (Ti ¼ 0 at. %). The MFM structures composed of Pt/ZnTiCrO/Pt displayed the polarizationdependent asymmetric hysteresis loops for the 6VA regions. Namely, a clear hysteresis with a window of 5 V only appeared in the þVA region while no hysteresis was observed in the –VA bias region. The results suggest that ZnCrTiO holds promise for potential applications of ferroelectric oxide-based two-terminal resistive-memory devices.",7,

Excellent resistive switching characteristics and reliable data retention proper- ties were also verified at RT and under thermal stress. More- over, they showed high mechanical flexibility in a repetitive bending test. Therefore, it is expected that the TFRRAM devices will mark a milestone in the development of future transparent and flexible electronic systems.",20,
456,"In this review, we discussed the recent progress in e-skin research, focusing on the technologies needed for three specific applications: skin attachable devices, robotics, and prosthetics. If developed fully, e-skin devices can enable continuous health monitoring and point-of-care diagnostics to improve people’s health. This is particularly important in this day and age as the life expectancy and various health risks are simultaneously on the rise. Also, e-skin will endow robotics and prosthetics with a “sense of touch,” enabling a wide variety of tasks currently not possible, such as manipulation of various objects and interaction with people. One can envision exciting possibilities such as robots that can conduct every day house chores and exchanging emotion with humans through tactile communication. Furthermore, amputees would regain full functionalities of human tactile capacity or even exceed it if the sensors can be engineered to detect external stimuli that are not possible with human skin. The research community has been working intensely toward this vision, and significant progress has been made over the past decade. Materials with intrinsic stretchability and self-healing ability have been developed through a variety of methods. Sensors of various kinds (tactile, chemical, and electrophysiological sensors) have been developed. Additionally, large-area fabrication and integration techniques, along with wireless communication, low-power-consumption signal processing technologies, and neural interfacing electrodes are being developed. However, despite these efforts, many challenges still remain. Below, we succinctly highlight some of these challenges.",36,
457,"In summary, we have fabricated SiOx-based RRAM with self-rectifying behavior by direct plasma-oxidation of silicon wafers at room-temperature. Bipolar and unipolar RS was observed in the Cu/SiOx/p-Si structure, whereas unipolar RS with self-rectifying behavior at LRS was obtained in the Cu/SiOx/n-Si structure. Such RS can be explained with formation/rupture of the Cu filament inside the SiOx matrix. Hence, it produces the Schottky barrier at the as-formed Cu filament/n-Si contact when the memory device at LRS, leading to produce a rectifying junction. Since the employed materials and processing are fully compatible with CMOS technology, this work provides a convenient and cost-efficient technical-route to develop crossbar array-based RRAM for nowadays Si-based semiconductor industry.",6,
458,"We also studied the effect of superconductivity on the resistive states of YBCO/NSTO. Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistances for the HRS (-3 V switching) and LRS (+2.5 V switching) of YBCO6.9 /NSTO. The LRS shows a metallic behavior, while the HRS shows a semiconducting behavior. The metallic behavior of the LRS is significant, suggesting the existence of conducting filaments through the junction barrier. Figures 3(b)–3(d) show the resistance changes at around Tc for YBCO6.9 film, LRS and HRS of YBCO6.9 /NSTO with and without a magnetic field. It can be seen that superconducting transition has remarkable influence on the resistance of the LRS with strong correlation. In contrast, the influence of superconducting transition on the HRS is minor. It has been shown in our previous paper that YBCO6.9 /NSTO is an inhomogeneous junction. The inhomogeneity of the barrier height distribution leads to the inhomogeneous distribution of the thickness of depletion layer, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(c). For the HRS, the resistance is mainly determined by the junction resistance, which gives a semiconductinglike behavior. Redistribution of current through the interface occurs at around Tc because the red region adjacent to the thinner depletion layer becomes superconducting [inset of Fig. 3(c)] and more carriers flow via low barrier regions, leading to the minor effect of superconducting transition on the junction resistance. For the LRS, the traps are filled by carriers and higher voltages result in the conducting filaments due to possible soft breakdown of the regions with low barrier height [gray region in the inset of Fig. 3(c)]. The conducting filaments are composed of YBCO6.9 and NSTO in series and go through the barrier layer. So the resistance of YBCO6.9 /NSTO shows a metallic conducting behavior and remarkable drop much larger than the resistance of YBCO6.9_x0002_ at around Tc of YBCO6.9. Interestingly, it has also been shown in Au/SrTiO3 :Nb Schottky junction that in the LRS some filaments formed through the junction barrier.",-1,
459,"We have developed a hybrid graphene oxide−titanium oxide nonvolatile resistive memory that not only offers the attractive features of “traditional” graphene oxide memories, such as the suitability for flexible and transparent electronics applications, a simple and cost-effective production etc., but also allows for a nanometric size-scaling, nanosecond switching speeds and multilevel (multibit) operation. Specifically, we have not only presented the smallest (50 nm), fastest (sub-5 ns), thinnest (8 nm) GO-based memory devices produced to date, but also demonstrated that our approach provides easily accessible multilevel (4-level, 2-bit per cell) storage capabilities along with excellent endurance and retention performanceall on both rigid and flexible substrates. Via comprehensive spectroscopic (XPS and Raman) and electrical characterization, backed-up by detailed atomistic simulations, we have shown that the resistive switching mechanism in our devices is driven by redox reactions in the interfacial region between the top (Ti) electrode and the GO layer. When the Ti metal is deposited on top of the GO film in order to form the top electrode, Ti atoms take oxygen groups from the first few nanometers of the oxygen-rich GO film, leading to a relatively thick (few nm) TiOx amorphous interface layer at the GO/Ti interface that acts as an insulating barrier, placing the cell in the HRS or RESET state. On the application of a negative bias to the top electrode, Ti−O chemical bonds are broken and oxygen ions diffuse back into the GO film. This transfer of oxygen groups away from the TiOx layer and back into the GO film lowers the interfacial energy barrier (between the top electrode and the GO) causing the cell resistance to decrease, thus putting the cell in the LRS state. The switching between HRS and LRS states is electrically reversible and repeatable, the states themselves are stable in air for prolonged durations, and devices fabricated on flexible plastic substrates withstood repeated and extensive bending. Our results will help transform the way in which we view the potential and possibilities for GO memory device development and applications.",73,
460,"In this paper we have extended the formalism of Darboux transformations to the NBE with full time-dependence in (1+1) dimensions. Our transformation can be viewed as the conventional Darboux transformation with a logarithmic deformation that arises from the Cole–Hopf transformation. As in the conventional case, our transformation allows for the generation of integrable NBEs and for the systematic search of nonhomogeneities that render the NBE integrable.",-1,
461,"In summary, the RS properties of Cu filament mediated ECM cells composed of either HfO2/TiO2 bi-layer or TiO2 single layer are compared. Due to the controlled and limited injection of Cu during the electroforming and set processes for the case of the HfO2/TiO2 bi-layer memory cell, the switching endurance and uniformity were greatly improved compared with the single layer memory cell. The reset/set switching power was also decreased by a factor of 100 due to the drastic decrease in appropriate compliance current level, whereas the switching voltage remained invariant. The LRS current of 30 lA and a resistance ratio that is slightly higher than 10 were highly favourable for fast and reliable sensing in RRAM using this memory cell.",71,
462,"In summary, we have demonstrated planar and vertical ferroelectric memristors using a layered semiconducting α-In2Se3 crystal. The IP polarization based planar memristor presents switchable photocurrent and gate tunability in the channel conductance, ferroelectric domain reversal and resistance-switching ratio. The OOP polarization based vertical α-In2Se3 memristor features a maximum resistance-switching ratio of 10^3 and can be integrated at a density of 7.1×10^9 per square inch. Additionally, we developed a multidirectionally operated memristor to demonstrate the OOP (or IP) resistance switching that can be achieved through IP (or OOP) pulse programming. The demonstrations in this work are applicable for future advanced functional nonvolatile memories and complex synaptic emulation.",8,
463,"The endurance failure mechanism in the Ti/HfOx bipolar RRAM with 1T–1R configuration induced by over-RESET energy is comprehensively studied. The degradation of memory device by over-RESET energy includes two stages. The degradation at first stage, where the resistance of LRS slightly increases, can be well explained by the worn filament model. And the degradation at second stage, where the resistance of LRS significantly increases and an unusual switching curve occurs, can be explained by the activation of self-CRS in the device. Our results suggest that the RESET operation needs to be carefully controlled to ensure robust endurance reliability in the Ti/HfOx bipolar RRAM.",30,
464,"In summary, we studied ReRAM device with Pt/SGO/Pt MIM structure and observed the multilevel resistance switching behaviour by varying the compliance current during the set process. The physical transport mechanism for the resistive switching behaviour was studied in a wide temperature range of 270–460 K, which indicated that the observed resistive switching can be explained by the formation/rupture of conductive filaments formed out of oxygen vacancies and metallic Gd atom. The observed multilevel conduction in the device was explained by the variation in the size of the conducting filament. The observed reproducible and nonvolatile multilevel resistive switching, good contrast in ON/OFF resistance ratio, high endurance, and amorphous structure make SGO as a promising material for the nonvolatile ReRAM devices.",-1,
465,"In summary, we presented a systematic study on the photovoltaic effect on the Schottky junction Au/SrTiO3 : 0.5 wt % Nb. The most remarkable observation is the strong dependence of the open-circuit photovoltage on junction resistance and the invariance of the short-circuit photocurrent during resistance switching. The distinctive photovoltaic effects can be understood based on an equivalent circuit model consisting of a diode in parallel with a resistor. These results suggest the occurrence of filamentary conductive channels across the interfacial barrier during resistance switching and invariance of remaining Schottky barriers.",2,
466,"We report nonpolar resistive switching operations after semi-forming and second forming in Pt/NiO/Pt stack cells, in which the NiO layers were deposited by reactive sputtering at various O_2 flow rates. Upon sweeping the applied voltage, the conductance fluctuates in some cells in the initial state and in the HRS after semi-forming. Fluctuations after semi-forming result in the cell conductance being a non-integer multiple of the quantized conductance G_0. The conductance increase owing to the fluctuations originates from the modification of oxygen-vacancy density at grain boundaries in the NiO layer. Moreover, this modification possibly disappears upon heating to 470 K through the formation of a conductive filament with a QPC created by semi-forming. Considering voltage- and heat-driven processes, the modification of oxygen-vacancy density can be seen as a possible precursor of a filament with a QPC by semi-forming or even of a fat conductive filament by second forming.",25,
467,"Furthermore, we considered the driving force at the origin of the reset based on the types of reset that occur after semi-forming in cells varying in size. The large Joule heating caused by the current through the fat filament created by second forming determines whether the cell conductance after reset takes on the value of the conductance just after second forming or that of the initial conductance depends. As a result, we consider the dominant driving force behind the reset in Pt/NiO/Pt cells to be Joule heating.",10,
468,"In summary, we report that stable rectification and resistive-switching properties exist in a Ti/TiO2 /Pt MIM fabricated at room temperature. The oxygen migration and localized conductive filaments play important roles in not only the resistive-switching of RRAM but also the rectification of oxide diodes. When the current conduction through the oxygen-deficient TiO2 filaments is limited by the interface Schottky barriers, the diode rectification prevails. After forming at higher voltage, much stronger filaments destroying the interface Schottky barrier give rise to the reproducible resistive-switching. The rectification properties stable up to 125 °C and 103 cycles under 3 V sweep without interference with resistive-switching show satisfactory reliability of TiO2 MIM diodes for future 1D1R RRAM applications.",24,
469,"In summary, a novel neuron device based on a unipolar ReRAM has been proposed. We veriﬁed the fundamental operations of the proposed device with SPICE simulations using the behavior model of the ReRAM. Consequently, our neuron device can exhibit both the OSC mode and EXC mode as similar to those of biological neurons. In particular, the latter one leads to the coincidence detection and pre- stimulus inhibition in response to pulse trains. Such neuronal behaviors are useful for pulse coding in the time domain. Since pulse coding is necessary for the Hebbian learning with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity synapses, our neuron device can complementary work with various kinds of synaptic devices including ReRAM synapses for next- generation neuromorphic systems.",39,
470,"In conclusion, we have shown the effects of various deposition and composition variables for NiO thin films. Also, the effects of these variables on bistable resistance switching have been shown. It can be seen that the existence of metallic Ni content plays an important role in resistance switching. In order to form NiO thin films with this Ni metal content, several methods are available. First, the oxygen partial pressure can be maintained at about 5% and substrate temperature at 400 °C as in our samples. Second, introduction of Ti doping can cause the metallic Ni content to appear even at higher partial pressures or lower temperatures. In addition, the film must exist in a polycrystalline state with pronounced relative _x0001_200 orientation as shown in the XRD data. The polycrystallinity of NiO thin films can be guaranteed by having a high deposition temperature or by introducing Ti doping at much lower temperatures and appropriate oxygen partial pressures. Room temperature processing through introduction of Ti impurities is important for integration of NiO films in RRAM for stacked structures.",29,
471,"In summary, effects of the dwell time and the annealing temperature on the evolution of the RS behaviors in the device with CSD-derived BFO thin films are investigated. For the low temperature annealed BFO thin films with low current, the rectifying RS behaviors are related to the polarization modulated interfacial barriers between the electrode and the films. With increasing annealing temperature, the increased oxygen vacancy lead to the decrease in the RS, even disappearance for the BFO thin films annealed at 550 C. With prolonging dwell time, the represented RS in the BFO thin films may be attributed to the variation of the interfacial depletion layer barriers rectified by the oxygen vacancy. The RS in the negative bias voltage region while overlapping I-V characteristic in the positive one for the device with BFO thin films annealed with long dwell time may caused by the formation of p-n junction in the films resulted from the increased bismuth vacancy",4,
472,"In conclusion, the interfacial layer effect on the RS behavior using the MnOx thin film was demonstrated by the comparative study between the Ti and the Pt top electrodes. To achieve highly promising electrical endurance characteristic, minimizing oxygen out-diffusion is an important factor, which can be accomplished with the appropriate metal electrode. It was also confirmed that the MnOx base RS has promising scalable and reliable properties using the 8 x 8 crossbar array devices with 100 nm interconnection line width.",34,
473,"In summary, a mixed layer composed of c-Fe2O3 and Pt-Fe2O3 core–shell NPs with a thickness of _x0004_30 nm and having a ratio of about 0.43:0.57 was formed between Ti and Pt electrodes through repeated dip-coating. The structure of Ti/mixed-NPs/Pt underwent an analog resistance change with decreasing resistance as applying voltage sweep and pulse of 1.5 V for 100 ms and increasing resistance as applying þ1.5 V. As the sweep voltage was increased to 63 V; the first SET transition, called the electroforming operation, occurred at approximately þ3 V. A subsequent RESET transition occurred at approximately 1 V, and SET transitions took place in the voltage range of þ1 to 2 V. This digital-type bipolar switching could also be achieved by pulse operation at 62 V for 100 ms with an on/off ratio of the order of _x0004_102 when reading at 0.1 V. The stable operation in a relatively low voltage range was ascribed to the presence of distributed metallic cores that bridged the segments of filaments by concentrating the electric field, thereby facilitating filament formation. These results demonstrate a potential pathway for further reducing the operation voltage by optimizing the distribution of core–shell NPs and thickness of the NPs layer.",56,
474,"In summary, we reported the observation of quantized conductance in AgInSbTe-based sandwiched structure. We utilized a high speed circuit to improve the integrity of the nanoseconds signal. When nanosecond positive voltage pulses with different widths were applied to the Ag electrode of the memristive cell, the cell exhibited stepwise increases in conductance at different speeds, which can be attributed to the formation of a metal filament whose contact to one of the electrodes consist of integer multiples of atoms. This finding offers the opportunity to achieve high speed and low power consumption multi-level storage in AIST-based memristor. Besides, the operation with constant amplitude is crucial to programming, and the short voltage pulses can effectively avoid misreading.36 In addition, the memristors with multi-level quantized conductance characteristic show the application potential for neuromorphic computing field.",8,
475,"ZnO and ZrO2 solutions were prepared by the sol–gel method. The Al(top)/ZnO/ZrO2/Al(bottom) structure fabricated at a low annealing temperature of 300 °C has advantages such as low cost and suitability for manufacturing large-area ReRAM devices. In addition, the Gibbs free energy in ZnO, which is higher than that in ZrO2, facilitates the oxidation and reduction reactions of filaments in the ZnO layer. The fabricated device exhibits excellent characteristics under bipolar or unipolar operation. Unlike a typical ReRAM device, this device does not require a forming process. The set voltage is between 1 and 2.5 V, and the reset voltage is in the 0 to ±2 V range. The BRS and URS are operations that the HRS/LRS also show more than two orders of magnitude.",-1,
476,"We concude that the kinetics of the SET operation in Cu–SiO2-based electrochemical metallization memory cells is determined by the electrocrystallization process at the cathode, in contrast to a rate-limiting Cu ion transport through the SiO2 film. Obviously, the voltage-time dilemma is overcome for ECM cells by the exponential dependence of the rate of this process on the switching voltage and a threshold voltage which may originate from the nucleation overpotential.",58,
477,"Fast measurements of the total erosion rates at the PFCS in ASDEX Upgrade have shown that at the outboard limiters 70 10% of the erosion is due to ELMs, while at the inboard heat shield the contribution is lower at a level of 40 10%. The ELM contribution does not depend on the energy loss during an ELM, i.e. less frequent larger ELMs cause the same contribution as more frequent smaller ELMs. The ratio of outboard to inboard erosion rates decreases when the plasma is shifted to the inboard. However, the balance is different during an ELM and between ELMs with a stronger outboard contribution during an ELM.",37,
478,"For tungsten, the transport in the ETB is dominated by the effect of Coulomb collisions, since it has an even higher collisional diffusion coefficient than the light elements, for which the agreement with purely collisional transport could be deduced from direct measurements. The collisional transport produces a strong inward pinch and a respective peaking of tungsten in the ETB which is relaxed during an ELM. When modelling the edge transport in ASDEX Upgrade with a 1D radial transport code that implements the parallel losses in the SOL as volume loss rates, the impurity confinement time shows a strong decrease with increasing ELM frequency as experimentally observed. However, there is an equally strong dependence on the characteristic parallel loss time in the SOL, which is at present not well known and requires further measurements to restrict this parameter in the model. The dependence on the diffusion coefficient in the SOL is very weak and can hardly be determined from measured confinement times.",37,
479,"In the ETB of ITER, the collisional impurity diffusion coefficient is about a factor of 20 smaller than in ASDEX Upgrade. Thus the time to build up a strong edge gradient is substantially longer; however, the ELM frequency has to be kept high (around 20–30 Hz) in order to achieve small ELMs. Thus, the average edge peaking will be quite small, provided that the ELMs do not lead to a much smaller increase in the effective diffusion coefficient than used in the model. Then, the high ELM frequency also helps to transport the helium across the plasma edge and does not lead to an unacceptably large value of τH∗e.",37,
480,"In summary, the RS of a polycrystalline NiO film involves the disproportionation/ comproportionation reactions revealed by focused XPS analysis. Besides the formation/ rupture of Ni filaments with the SET/ RESET process, Ni2O3 is produced/ reduced as a consequence. The reversibility of the reactions can be thermodynamically explained by the Gibbs energy. From the CAFM result, the filaments expand/ contract with the forward/ reverse reaction. The reaction becomes irreversible as the filaments grow larger than the range the reaction can reach.",29,
481,"In summary, simultaneous switching of local transmittance, oxygen content, and resistance state of the planar Au/ WO3-x/Au devices were demonstrated by electric measurements combined with in-situ optical observation. We found the strip-like WO3-x device possessed self-regulated RS behavior, of which the switching parameters would be stabilized during an endurance testing. The high mobility of O2– ions in WO3-x film measured by pulse experiment was larger than 10 9 cm2V 1s 1. We suggested that the homogeneous migration of O2–s along electric field distribution was the physical origin for the self-regulated behavior and aspect ratio effect. The unique RS characteristics of planar WO3-x stripes give us some fundamental guidance of optimal design for the vertical RRAM devices based on such high ion mobility materials.",1,
482,"In summary, we investigated resistive switching in two types of Ni-doped graphene devices. We observed that the GO+Ni Nano+PVA+PAA+H+/GO/FE-Ni series has a different switching polarity compared to the GO+Ni Nano- PVA+PAA+Hydrazine+/GO/FE-Ni one, emphasizing the importance of the fabrication method on device behavior. Resistive switching in graphene oxide structures can then be caused by the diffusion of oxygen or metallic ions from the electrode under a bias voltage. The activity-dependent modification capacity of graphene oxide was also demonstrated, showing that it may be a promising material for future applications in neuromorphic systems.",32,
483,"In conclusion, we had designed an electronic memristor synapse based on the Ti/2D-BiOI/FTO structure and the resistance switching characteristics were explored. The device has displayed stable and reliable resistive switching behaviors, and has good conduction modulation with the pulses applied, data retention for over 1.4 104 s, HRS/ LRS distribution centralization, and 100 cycle endurance during the SET and RESET process. Meanwhile, the switching mechanism between the high and low resistance states is explained by XPS depth analysis, which provides a theoretical basis for the future optimization of the 2D-BiOI device. By exploring the similarities between memristors and synapses, we have acquired intelligent devices with autonomous learning capabilities. A variety of important synaptic learning and memory functions have been implemented in this memristive device, including synaptic plasticity and empirical learning behavior. The realization of important synaptic functions and the establishment of dynamic models can facilitate more accurate modeling of synapses in artificial neural networks.",3,
484,"The resistance change induced by the polarization reversal resulted in a factor of 60 in the 20-nm-thick VDF=TrFE copolymer ﬁlm fabricated on n-Si substrate. When the heavily doped Si with a resistivity of 1–3 mΩ·cm is used, the entire polarization reversal was observed and the electroresistance eﬀect was mainly explained by the Thomas–Fermi screening theory. The ratio of electroresistance eﬀect can be increased by decreasing the density of electrons in Si because both the Thomas–Fermi screening length and the depletion length increase the eﬀective barrier height. However, the polarization stability also depends on the density of electrons, and heavily doped Si is required for the entire polarization reversal. Thus, on the basis of the results obtained in this study, we can conclude that the optimum density of electrons is obtained in the resistivity range of 1–10 mΩ·cm for a metal/VDF–TrFE=Si structure.",17,
485,"The Ohmic and PF conduction mechanisms of URS mode are consistent with the predictions of a filament model that explains resistive switching by formation and rupture of the conduction filaments involved with thermal effects and trap sites such as oxygen vacancies [Fig. 2(b)].As positive voltage is applied to Ag electrode of the asfabricated device, conductive filaments made of the created oxygen vacancies are formed between top and bottom electrodes through the film and the film is electroformed and transformed to the LRS. Thicker or denser filaments could be formed in URS mode because of the electroforming with higher Ic; this formation can be expected because during LRS, resistance in URS mode (~10 K) is less than in BRS mode (~60 K). When another voltage is applied to the LRS film, current flows through the conductive filaments. Joule heating is intense enough to rupture filaments, so the filament is broken and the film returns to HRS. In this way, voltage polarity is not important, because only the current determines the amount of heat. However, since the filaments are not thick or dense enough in case of BRS mode, relatively smaller current flows through the filaments and cannot generate enough heat to break them; thus the film cannot be transformed to LRS. However, when negative voltage is applied to Ag electrode, the oxygen ions diffuse back from the oxidized Ag electrode to the film. They fill the oxygen vacancies in the film near the Ag electrode and thus the filament is disconnected so the film can return to HRS. Unlike URS mode, such local electrochemical redox reactionbe tween anode and the filament is widely accepted mechanism of BRS.This can be deduced from the results that the resistance of LRS is not dependent on the size of top electrodes. Moreover, this independency indicates that the filaments are formed along the dislocations such as grain boundaries of columnarcrystalline structure of ZnO thin film. From all these results we suggest the mechanism of URS and BRS of the ZnO film using Jouleheating and electrochemical redox reaction mechanism, respectively. For better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, further studies are required such as real time analysis of temperature, film composition and/or resistance change in future work.",25,
486,"In this work, we presented operando HAXPES measurements for investigating the resistive switching mechanisms taking place in a TiN/LMO/Pt memory cell under the application of an electrical bias. The use of HAXPES has successfully demonstrated its ability to observe buried interfaces and fingerprint relevant modifications occurring during resistive switching. In particular, spectra recorded during the process reveal changes in the composition of both the TiN electrode and the LMO itself. Fitting of the Ti 1s spectra (and confirmed by the O 1s spectra) clearly indicates a partial oxidation of the TiN electrode and reduction of the LMO surface during RESET followed by the reverse reactions during SET. The mechanism can be described by a redox reaction triggered by the oxygen drift at the TiN/LMO interface due to the external bias. The TiOxNy interlayer plays the role of an oxygen getter during RESET, expelling oxygen back into LMO during the SET process. Thanks to careful operando spectroscopic analysis, we proposed a redox model to fully describe the physiochemical mechanism occurring in a potential technologically relevant memory cell consisting in a LaMnO3+δ active layer and a TiN top electrode.",57,
487,"In conclusion, reversible and fast resistance switching was achieved via effective electrostatic tuning in the VO2- based FETs with the hybrid gate insulator, which was considered to effectively reduce interface defects and promote sheet carrier density. The maximum resistance modulation was verified to appear near TMI. Another fascinating behavior on an unequal drop in TMI by the hole-electron modulation was observed. Our findings pave a way for the application of oxide thin films-based switch devices with the RT control.",49,
488,"In summary, we fulfill the large number of requirements for efficient neuromorphic computing in a single organic ECRAM device: linear resistance tuning with a >2× dynamic range, fast switching (20 ns), submicrosecond write-read cycling, low-voltage (±1 V) and low-energy (~80 fJ per write) operation, low noise ((∆G^2/σ^2 > 100), and excellent endurance both at room temperature and at elevated temperature (>109 write-read operations at 90°C). Our materials selection strategy proves to be quite general, as it can be effectively implemented using various ionic liquids and other block copolymers (fig. S7). In contrast, it has been proven difficult to optimize PCMs and ReRAMs across all metrics, such as attaining both low write noise and low current operation, which are needed for scaling to large arrays.",51,
489,"While this work represents a fundamental step toward designing organic ECRAMs to be compatible with fabrication into high-density synaptic arrays, some important challenges remain due to the strict temperature and contamination requirements for integration with CMOS. Alternative fabrication pathways exist for integrating emerging nonvolatile memories with CMOS, such as low-temperature monolithic 3D integration of carbon nanotubes and ReRAMs (29), and remain an active area of pursuit to improve such compatibility.",51,
490,"Last, we emphasize that the ECRAM concept is not limited to organic materials. The lessons learned here, such as the importance of mobile species infiltrating the channel before electrochemical gating and possibly relying on proton conduction for fast switching, can also benefit ECRAMs made with other ion intercalation materials such as 2D materials, van der Waals heterostructures, or MXene composites.",51,
491,"Reversible and controllable conversion between URS and BRS has been observed in the same memory device of Pt/TiO2/Pt. A unified model for the conversion between URS and BRS was proposed, which demonstrated the unification of filament and interfacial model.

492,"In summary, we have demonstrated almost symmetrical BRS characteristic in the nearly transparent In/Zn Al O/Cu device. Above surface null potential, formation and rupture of systematic conducting filamentary paths and the migration of oxygen vacancies (V• and V••) under applied bias drive the device to RS behavior. The formation of an interface insulating layer between electrodes and AZO also affects behavior of the device. At a relatively high applied bias, the BRS behavior is Al3þ and parasitic capacitor driven. Further experiments to understand the role of Al3þ are in progress. The device shows excellent endurance and retention properties over the different experimental conditions. The results presented here shed some light on AZO as prospective candidate for fabrication of future low operating potential memristor device applications.",45,
493,"In conclusion, we have observed multilevel RS phenomenon in perovskite nanostructures. The high visible transmittance of the device has been confirmed. In addition, the device shows multileveled RS that be tuned well by choosing appropriate applied forming pulse. Moreover, the device shows voltage pulse-dependent gradual change in current, making it suitable for neuromorphic computing. The observed results are explained in terms of field- induced ionic migration and in turn improvement in the filament size. The results suggest that the optimization of the conductive filament active region is key for the future resistive switching devices. The present results will be a benchmark to design controlled resistive nanostructure- based memory devices.",12,
494,"In this paper, we have demonstrated that Al-doping improves the switching characteristics of TiOx-based RRAMcells. The Al:TiOx-based devices were electroformed on average at -5.7V compared to -6.4V for the undoped devices. Both doped and undoped devices could support both analog and binary switching, subject to the pulsing scheme, in a repeatable manner for a large number of cycles. The majority of Al:TiOx-based devices were operating in the 100–300kΩ resistance regime and the switching voltages were typically of +1.2 V/-1.0 V. The TiOx devices were operating at higher potentials, typically at +1.8 V/-1.4V (in analog mode) and +1.5 V/-1.0V (in binary mode). The relative standard deviation of resistance states was improved for doped devices.",46,
495,"The device operation is realised through a filamentary mechanism, which did not change with the Al doping. The valence difference between the Al and Ti could be the key for the reduction of the oxygen vacancy formation energy, therefore lowering the EF and switching voltages. These results are encouraging for the TiOx RRAM optimisation; however, more in depth investigation has to be carried out to unravel the full potential of Al doping.",46,
496,"Considering the ever increasing bit capacity for non-volatile memory, while most of them would be embedded on logic chip with the least amount of power consumption for programming and long enough retention with lower cost of manufacturing against their predecessor, the magnitude of challenges should grow significantly. Resistance switching memory family such as RRAM, in principle, seems having a good potential of meeting those requirements, but we need to ask a set of rather fundamental questions before a large scale implementation with peripheral circuits design considerations:",23,

Out of the above list, the last item would require much broader spectrum of scientific/engineering efforts as we need to handle larger number of knobs to turn and optimize, but this may result in another break-through in terms of materials, processes, device structures and integration.",33,
499,"In summary, the polarity origin has been discussed based on the investigation of BRS effects in junctions with various top electrodes. We find that the AG of the top electrode oxide determines the switching polarity. It has been verified that the redox reaction of the top electrode oxide layer at the M  LCMO interface results in the positive BRS. Meanwhile, the generation/annihilation process of the oxygen vacancy located at the oxygen-deficient layer at the M  LCMO inter- face may contribute to the negative BRS effect. The present work also suggests a possible way to control the resistance switching polarity by the interface engineering.",64,
500,"In summary, we identify two mechanisms of conductive path formation inside a thin film of silver sulfide. The first mechanism is the formation of a metallic silver filament which we associate with the observation of atomic conduct- ance steps. Second, there is a modification of the silver sulfide structure to a higher-conductance phase. The conductance of this modified structure is continuously tunable, and allows setting the conductance to any target value by applying appropriate positive voltages. Contrary to previous reports,9,16 we argue that this controllable switching cannot be attributed to an intrinsic atomic scale structure. The memory functions explored by Ohno et al.9 cannot be explained by a metallic filament formation alone. Our results point toward the role of the two switching mechanisms in deciding whether the infor- mation is maintained for shorter or longer times.",29,
501,"In conclusion, SiOx RRAM bulk and edge devices have been electroformed and tested in vacuum. Electrical test in oxygen ambient shows that un-encapsulated edge devices lose resistive switching capability and memory characteristics, most likely due to oxidation of the Si-rich filament. With SU-8 epoxy encapsulation, the bulk device achieves stable state switching in air ambient. The SU-8 epoxy is believed to hermetically seal the device to prevent oxygen from permeating into the SiOx layer, thus enabling reversible switching in air. This work illustrates that, with proper structure and encapsulation, the SiOx RRAM can be operated in air ambient, which is a critically important step for integration with CMOS technology and use in advanced nonvolatile memory applications.",-1,
502,"In summary, by modified and temperature controlled spin coating technique, we prepared P3HT/P(VDF-TrFE) blend films with improved roughness at deposition temperature between 50 and 70 °C, which was proved by AFM analyses. SEM and PFM measurements were conducted to distinguish both ferroelectric and semiconducting phases and also to determine the dimension of P3HT domains. Leakage current characteristic was also measured to study the influence of surface roughness. Current−voltage measurements further determined the resistive switching characteristic and retention property of blend films deposited at 50 °C. These experimental observations proved the feasibility of improving the fabrication yield of organic semiconducting/ferroelectric blend resistive devices by increased coating temperature between 50 and 70 °C.",17,
503,"In summary, the electrical activities and characters of dislocations in Nb-doped (111) SrTiO3 have been studied by EBIC, etch pits, and TEM. Dislocations of screw, edge, and mixed types co-existed and most dislocations have Burgers vectors of h110i type. Dislocations exhibited dark EBIC contrast at room temperature suggesting the presence of recombination centers. When changing the bias condition or accelerating voltage, bright EBIC contrast was observed around certain dislocations. It is considered that dislocations in SrTiO3 are associated with different defect levels depending on their characters. Dislocations with line vector of [111] tend to have shallow levels and relate to the resistance switching",2,
504,"In summary, we report quantized conductance behaviors in oxide-based sandwiched structures. The conductance quantization behaviors can be attributed to the creation and annihilation of atomic scale conducting fi laments inside the insulting matrix. These studies clearly reveal the scaling potential of these two-terminal resistive switching devices, and can be used to achieve multi-level data storage. In addition, the controlled formation of atomic scale conduction channels in simple two-terminal devices in air and at room temperature can provide a platform to develop new one-dimensional nano-devices based on quantum effects. For example, by replacing the electrode material with magnetic metals or oxides and replacing the insulating layer with complex oxide such as multi ferroic materials, one can potentially study strongly correlated effects in a confi ned channel that can be tuned by an applied electrical field.",-1,
505,"In summary, a RRAM-based synaptic neuromorphic network is proposed to learn and recognize spatiotemporal patterns, including spike sequences and spike groups (for example, pairs) where the spike timing carries information. The time difference of spikes among different neurons provides spatiotemporal coding with high sparsity and high information capacity. Our experiments demonstrate that the RRAM-based SNN, combined with suitable neuron circuit and operation scheme, is capable of learning spatiotemporal patterns via STDP, followed by recognition, thanks to suitably potentiated/depressed synapses. The results provide one step forward toward biorealistic computing machines capable of paralleling the energy efficiency and computing functionality of the brain.",13,
506,"To conclude, in this letter, we have demonstrated that the progressive reset transition between the low and high resistance states in HfO2-based RS devices can be modeled using a diode-like conduction mechanism with a series resistance in combination with a generalized logistic model for the pre-exponential diode current amplitude factor. The proposed dynamics has been interpreted in terms of the sequential deactivation of multiple conduction channels spanning the dielectric film. Fitting results indicate that the switching behavior dynamics can be described by the same equation regardless of the voltage sweep rate. Finally, partial reset I-V curves were characterized and modeled using the same approach, which gives further support to the proposed picture. ",5,
507,"In summary, we focus on the resistance switching and electric- ﬁeld-induced magnetization modulation based on the Ag/TP/ Al structure. The TiO2 ﬁlm was synthesized by magnetron sputtering on PAA substrates. Large magnetization changes of the TP ﬁlms emerge in response to the resistance switching eﬀect of the Ag/TP/Al heterostructure controlled by applied electric ﬁeld. Our results provide convincing evidence for the inﬂuence of oxygen vacancies on resistive behavior and magnetization modulation in undoped TP nanoporous ﬁlms. Furthermore, the results suggest that the magnetic ordering might be obtained by regulating the kinds of anion vacancy defects in semiconductor oxides. The combination of the resistance switching and magnetism modulation caused by electric ﬁeld at room temperature makes it possible to integrate both ferromagnetism and electrical properties into a simple Ag/TP/Al structure, which can be extended to produce other novel dilute magnetic semiconductors and is expected to be used in new memory and new spintronic devices.",64,
508,"We have demonstrated resistance modulation by changing the RESET pulse width with tantalum oxide based RRAM devices. We performed SET-RESET switching for each resistance level 105 times, showing excellent endurance behavior for each level. Several research groups have demonstrated MLC operation in TaOx based RRAM, mostly by changing the peak current compliance during switching12 or by changing the RESET stop voltage and RESET pulse height.4 Hu et al. have shown multi-level resistance with TaOx based RRAM through controlling different RESET stop voltages and different compliance currents in direct current voltage sweeping modes and by means of different pulse erasing voltages in pulse programming/erasing modes.13 In many cases, individual resistance levels were not switched for a sufficient number of cycles, and many of the resistance states exhibited large variation. In this study, when using bilayer TaOx based RRAM with Hf as the OEL, each resistance level was uniform and non-overlapping and hence is suitable for applications where cycle to cycle uniformity is of utmost importance. We propose two possible reasons for this uniformity. First, the ls timescale for pulse applications could be helpful for achieving stable and uniform resistance levels. In particular, we observed that shorter RESET pulse widths were associated with reduced resistance variability [Figs. 2(a) and 4(a)]. Second, the Hf OEL and substoichiometric TaOy layer may have led to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, which in turn could induce higher vacancy movement and facilitate more uniform resistance levels. For oxygen vacancy concentrations greater than a certain level, the local lattice becomes distorted and strained, leading to a greatly increased diffusion constant for oxygen vacancies.14 These devices also show good endurance and retention and high Roff/Ron ratio for longer cycles. For a fixed RESET pulse height, a change in the pulse width caused a gradual change in the resistance level. Changing the pulse height while keeping the pulse width fixed, however, caused a drastic change in Roff. These results demonstrate multilevel storage capability and suggest that our devices are amenable to applications such as neuromorphic computing and hardware based encryption systems. Finally, based on the electrical measurement results, curve fitting, and temperature based study, we suggest that Schottky emission dominates at the HRS, while trap assisted tunneling dominates at higher voltages, and the device switches from HRS to LRS through a transition from Schottky emission to tunneling.",71,
509,"In summary, we fabricated the highly transparent Ag/ HfO2/ITO device for nonvolatile ReRAM applications. The XRD pattern revealed the presence of a monoclinic phase with an average crystallite size of 21.5 nm. The calculated optical band gap was found to be 5.88 eV. The Ag/HfO2/ ITO memory device exhibited high transparency and reliable bipolar resistive switching behavior. The bipolar resistance switching mechanism can be described based on the formation and disruption induced by oxygen vacancy migration and redox reactions at interfaces between the HfO2 layer and bias-applied electrode. The results of this study are encouraging for the fabrication of HfO2 transparent nonvolatile ReRAM devices. Furthermore, the proposed method is cost effective and environment friendly.",5,
510,"In summary, we have presented a novel structural design inspired by combining the characteristics of e-skin and e-textile into a stretchable single stimuli-responsive sensor. The low_xFFFE_cost fabrication method of stencil printing biocarbon composite films onto silver-plated nylon enables control of the resistivity switching under compressive stress through variation of the film thickness. The piezoresistive operation mode of the devices enabled a remarkable pressure sensitivity (up to 60.8 kPa−1 ) with a wide dynamic range (∼50 kPa). This corresponded to a maximum relative resistance change of ΔR/ R0 ∼104 from the low to medium pressure regime, while showing unresponsiveness to tensile strain (ΔR/R0 ≈ −30% for ε > 100%) and bending (ΔR/R0 ≈ −12% for rb = 4 mm). Decoupling of strain was not possible with capacitive operation mode due to dimensional change dominant responses. However, the capacitive operation mode of the device enabledhigh precision strain sensing for human motion monitoring. The high stability of the device was illustrated by 39 h of continuous operation. Excellent durability was demonstrated by machine washing for 30 cycles at 40 °C with 1200 rpm with no changes in physical dimensions, electromechanical responses or contact resistance of the electrodes. The response and recovery times of a sensor were less than 10 ms for normal pressure. The fascinating characteristics of these devices are anticipated to pave the way for new user-interactive systems and environments capable of visual feedback and interactions with human, robotics, or even prosthetics.",36,

The Al-chelated gelatin biomaterial memory with a transmittance of 83% at 550 nm, an ON/OFF current ratio of more than 10^5 , bipolar resistive switching, and the set voltage of around -0.5 V can be achieved. The switching operation of ACG memory devices was governed by the SCLC model and formation of filament paths. The chelate effect of Al ion with gelatin plays an important role in opening a transparent memory window. Good retention and endurance performance make the potential of transparent ACG-based memory devices for resistive memories and bioelectronic applications.",0,
512,"The scenario is distinct from those reported for other RS cells, especially in the ECM cells, that is, both the RESET and SET voltages decrease when humidity increases.4,7) In the ECM cells, it has been suggested that moisture participates in the electrochemical reactions and even in the cation migration; thus, it still works in RESET and SET and decreases the threshold voltages. However, the effect of moisture on the nonpolar cells is implemented by changing the current as well as the voltage distribution in the cell. It becomes invalid after FORMING when the electrode=oxide barriers vanish. The modulation of the top interface barrier by moisture adsorbates is likely the cause of the polaritydependent behaviors in nonpolar cells. This reminds us that barrier engineering, which has always been considered essential to bipolar devices, also acts a role in nonpolar devices. Such observations help to enrich our understanding of the mechanism of nonpolar switching.",-1,
513,"In conclusion, we show that self-organization of the TiO2 (110) surface layer during the Ar+ sputtering process is a promising way of producing a template for high-resolution resistive switching on the nanoscale. We concentrated on the description of the complexity of the sputtering-induced transformation of the crystal regarding the changes occurring in topography (morphology), stoichiometry, electronic structure, and electric transport. We were able to analyze the changes in conductivity both in- and out-of-plane of the crystal surface layer. The presented results prove that from the beginning of the sputtering process we are dealing with a transformation in the morphology and heterogeneous distribution of surface conductivity, which can be correlated with the decrease in the oxygen stoichiometry and oxidation state of Ti. However, such changes are also observed for some of the prolonged sputtering period, when a balance of surface stoichiometry, oxidation state of Ti and conductance is already established. At the early stages of the process, we find (by LC-AFM measurements at various temperatures) the electrical signature of the presence of the Ti2O3 phase in the sputtered layer. As a consequence of increasing time of Ar+ ion bombardment, the surface adopts a self-organized grainlike structure with grain dimensions increasing (with sputtering time) up to 50 nm. Based on the investigations of the cleavage plane of the previously sputtered crystal, we estimated the thickness of such a quasi-2D layer as 30 nm. The electrical conductivity of the layer displays a very sharp boundary. Our results show that on the surface of TiO2 crystal the Ar+ ion sputtering process produces a self-organized template for resistive switching in which each of the grains can be individually addressed (electrically) and switched between the semiconducting (OFF) and metallic (ON) state. The observed phenomenon has a unique potential for use in a very well-located data storage concept. ",35,
514,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated unipolar-type resistance switching in an amorphous niobium oxide (NbOx) device. The temperature dependences of resistance states revealed that electrical conduction in the LRS is similar to that in metals. XPS measurements showed that metallic NbOδ suboxides (1≤δ<2) decomposed from NbO2 and Nb2O5 were created after the forming process, suggesting that electrically-induced channels consists of such metallic elements. The XPS technique can be more broadly applicable to other resistance switching oxides, improving our understanding of the switching phenomena.",16,
515,"In summary, we have fabricated 3Dstacked 8 × 8 crossbar-structure organic resistive memory devices in which a composite of PI:PCBM was successfully employed as a thermally and chemically robust active organic material for stacked memory cells. The fabrication yields of the operating memory cells were more than 83% in the three-layer assembly reported here. The memory cells in each layer exhibited high performance with regard to non-volatile memory characteristics: they performed well under repetitive writing and erasing, had good switching endurance, and exhibited extrapolated memory retention times over a year with 10 3 ON/OFF current ratios. This study will enable highly integrated—and therefore more practical—organic memory devices and other organic-based electronic devices in the stackable 3D architecture with much increased cell density.",22,
516,"Although the cross-point circuit is inherently accurate and scalable, the imperfections of RRAM devices such as conductance discretization and stochastic variation (18) might affect the solution. To study the impact of these issues on the solution accuracy, we assumed a RRAM model with 32 discrete conductance levels, including 31 uniformly spaced levels and one deep high-resistance state, which is achievable in many resistive memory devices (39–41). The ratio between the maximum conductance Gmax and the minimum conductance Gmin is assumed to be G_max Gmin = 103 , in line with previous reports (42, 43). To describe conductance variations, we assumed an SD  = ∆G/6, ∆G/4, or ∆G/2, where ∆G is the nominal difference between two adjacent conductance levels. The simulation results for the Boston housing benchmark (fig. S17) shows that the resulting regression and prediction remain accurate for all cases. For the worst case ( = ∆G/2), the SD P of training set is equal to $4756 compared with the ideal result of $4732. The P of test set for prediction is even closer to the ideal one, namely, $4765 compared with $4769. These results highlight the suitability of the cross-point resistive memory circuit for ML tasks, where the device variations can be tolerated for regression, prediction, and classification.",59,
517,"Another concern for large-scale circuits is the parasitic wire resistance. To study its impact on the accuracy of linear regression for Boston housing dataset, we adopted interconnect parameters at a 65-nm technology obtained from the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors table (44), together with the RRAM model. The results in fig. S18 show an increased P for both regression and prediction, with the latter being less notable, which is consistent with the impact of device variation. Specifically, the P of prediction becomes merely $4809 compared with the ideal $4769, thus supporting the robustness of the linear regression circuit for predictive analysis.",59,
518,"The circuit stability analysis in text S1 reveals that the poles of the system all lie in the left half plane; thus, the circuit is stable, and the computing time is limited by the bandwidth corresponding to the first pole, which is the minimal eigenvalue (or real part of eigenvalue) min (absolute value) of a quadratic eigenvalue problem (45). As min becomes larger, the computation of the circuit gets faster, with no direct dependence on the size of the dataset. To support this scaling property of the circuit speed, we have simulated the transient dynamics of linear regression of the Boston housing dataset and its subsets for increasing size of the training samples (fig. S19). The results show that the computing time may even decrease as the number of samples increases, which can be explained by the different min of the datasets (fig. S20). These results evidence that the time complexity of the cross-point circuit for linear regression substantially differs from its counterparts of classical digital algorithms, with a potential of approaching size-independent time complexity to hugely speed up large-scale ML problems. Note that as the circuit size increases, a larger current is also required to sustain the circuit operation, which might be limited by the capability of the OAs. To control the maximum current consumption in the circuit, the memory element should be carefully optimized by materials and device engineering (46) or by advanced device concepts such as electrochemical transistor (47, 48) to provide a lowconductance implementation. The impact of device variations and the energy efficiency of the circuit are studied for the two-layer neural network for MNIST dataset training (text S6 with fig. S21). The results support the robustness of the circuit against device variations for classification applications, and an energy efficiency of 45.3-tera operations per s per Watt (TOPS/W), which is 19.7 and 6.5 times better than the Google’s tensor processing unit (49) and a highly optimized application-specific integrated circuit system (50), respectively.",59,
519,"In conclusion, the cross-point circuit has been shown to provide a one-step solution to linear regression and logistic regression, which is demonstrated in experiments with RRAM devices. The one-step learning capability relies on the high parallelism of analog computing by physical Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s law within the circuit and physical iteration within the nested feedback architecture. The scalability of the cross-point computing is demonstrated with large problems, such as the Boston housing dataset and the MNIST dataset. The results evidence that in-memory computing is remarkably promising for accelerating ML tasks with high latency/energy performance in a wide range of data-intensive applications.",59,
520,"In summary, first, a method based on displacement reaction and spontaneous electrolysis was developed to synthesize AgTCNQ nanowires facilely and efficiently in a large area. Second, it is unveiled that the switching riddle of AgTCNQ is due to the solid electrolyte mechanism. Bulk phase change of AgTCNQ to electrochemically form Ag species under external induction could be utilized to improve the interface contact between the electrode and AgTCNQ, allowing On/Off switching of the devices. Both factors bulk phase change and contact issues play key roles in the efficient work of the devices. It is the first time that the switching mechanism of AgTCNQ is unveiled. Furthermore, large area asymmetric electrodes (Au/Al) were facilely fabricated using a “multi-step mask moving” method, which could be scaled down to sub-micrometer level without the need of lithography. On this basis, novel planar electrochemical metallization memories with Au/AgTCNQ/AlOx/Al structure were efficiently constructed. The ultrathin AlOx insulator interface natively formed on Al electrode was used to locate the growth/rupture of Ag conductive filaments that originated from the AgTCNQ nanowire. Finally, the efficiency of filament controllability using this strategy leads to many promising properties of high On/Off resistance ratio (>104 ), excellent endurance (3000 cycles), long retention time (104 s), self-compliant and self-rectifying behavior as well as multilevel data storage capability. Taken together, these findings provide the potential to improve the design of materials and device architecture for high performance nonvolatile memories.",44,
521,"In summary, the coexistence and conversion of unipolar and bipolar switching behaviors are demonstrated in the device of Pt/ LATP/Pt. The conversion of the URS and BRS was freely conducted without altering the compliance current. The switching voltage and current were also confirmed to be of the same level. As a result, the SET and RESET operations can be performed at any polarity. Then, the Pt/LATP/Pt device can be categorized as a type of resistive memory which is called any-polar RRAM. The any-polar RRAM is expected to find its unique application in future nonvolatile memory.",70,
522,"We have investigated the effect of Ca doping on the RS characteristics of Pt/CBFO/SrRuO3 devices. The devices comprising CBFO ﬁlms with Ca-doping ratios of 6.4–13at.% had a large leakage current and showed zerocrossing hysteretic I–V curves, indicating the emergence of bipolar RS. According to the ferroelectric phase diagram of the CBFO ﬁlm, these Ca-doping ratios are in the stable ferroelectric or the ferroelectric-instability phases. However, pulsed-voltage-induced RS and good retention characteristics were observed in the devices with Ca-doping ratios only in the stable ferroelectric phase. In the pulsed-voltageinduced RS experiments, a large RS ratio was obtained in the device with a Ca-doping ratio just below the phase boundary between the stable ferroelectric and ferroelectricinstability phases. These ﬁndings indicate that the coexistence of robust ferroelectricity and moderate conductivity is a prerequisite for obtaining good RS characteristics and will provide a guide for optimizing the RS characteristics of diode-type ferroelectric RS devices.",4,
523,"In conclusion, we demonstrated resistive switching devices using an organolead halide perovskite on rigid and flexible substrates. With a suitable amount of the hydroiodic acid additive, morphologically improved solution-processed 300 nm thick smooth CH_3NH_3PbI_3 films with Ag top and Pt bottom electrodes exhibited electroforming-free resistive switching with over 1300 cycles of endurance and high ON/OFF ratios of ~10^6 under +0.3 V and –0.7 V pulses. Using the improved solution process, a flexible resistive switching device was achieved with an extremely low bending radius of 5 mm. According to the electrical properties at various temperatures, the SCLC and thermal-assisted hopping mechanism in HRS and ohmic conduction in LRS resulted from the unique electrical properties of the organolead halide perovskite. Moreover, the migration of Ag ions from the top electrode contributes to the formation of the conducting filament. However, improvements in retention time and nanosecond-level operation speed are also necessary and can be established by the control of crystallinity and compositional uniformity in fabrication processes of the OHP films. We believe that organolead halide perovskite memories have potential for high-speed operation and as mechanically stable flexible devices with flexible electrodes based on improved fabrication processes. The various combinations and unique structural flexibility for the lead-free ABX_3-type will contribute to maximizing the performance of environment-friendly organometal halide perovskite devices. Finally, we believe that organometal halide perovskite materials are promising materials for low-cost low-power consumption flexible memories.",12,
524,"In summary, coexistence of URS and BRS modes has been observed in 0.5% Ag-NPs doped NFO films prepared by the solution process method. The required voltages for switching operations in the URS mode were smaller than those in the BRS mode. However, resistance levels of both URS and BRS modes in low and high resistance states were identical. Cycle-to-cycle uniformity (>103 cycles) in the URS mode was considerably better than that in the BRS mode. And good endurance (>600 cycles) and excellent retention characteristics at high temperature were confirmed for the memory cells in the URS mode. The doping of 0.5% Ag-NPs into NFO based memory devices has greatly enhanced the RS performance, because doping of Ag-NPs provided an easy and controllable path to the formation and rupture of conductive filaments. Our results suggest that the Joule heating effect and electrochemical redox reaction play a key role in the URS and BRS modes.",41,
525,"In conclusion we demonstrate resistive switching in a fully room temperature fabricated WOx RRAM device. Pt/WOx/W device shows good reproducible resistance states, excellent, long retention at 85 ℃ and fast switching. The present device can be used for multi-bit application by choosing proper programming current or programming voltage.",71,
526,Significant improvements of the cycling endurance and dispersion of switching voltages were accomplished by the addition of Cu-IL to the HfO2 layer of a Cu=HfO2=Pt device. The present study shows the high feasibility of the marked improvement of CBRAM performance by the fusion of solid porous bodies and liquids.,11,
527,"In summary, we have modeled the effects of oxide phases, oxide stoichiometry, and dopant concentrations on the forming characteristics of doped-HfOx RRAM, using density-functional theory calculations. The physical insights derived from the calculations provide guidelines to achieve desirable RRAM characteristics through doping. Especially, the inconsistent observations regarding the dopant effects on forming voltages are explained by the variation of oxygen stoichiometry. In the case of Al dopants, only nonstoichiometric oxide will activate the dopant effects and result in significant reduction of forming voltages.",24,
528,"We demonstrated significant improvements in the resistive switching uniformity of GST-based ReRAM devices. Based on the effect of the ER, similar uniformity improvement was obtained by introducing interfacial oxide. Highly switching uniformity is achieved by the interfacial oxide layer, which intentionally controlled current. Furthermore, the devices exhibited good memory performance, e.g., large on/off resistance ratio and reliable data retention.",41,
529,"By using the optical superlattice model, we calculate the ARs of leaded AP made within the last 2000 years, and find that for incident light with a suitable wavelength, the AR of the leaded AP increases monotonously with the increase in the layer number of the SG media. Based on this property, we propose an optical nondestructive method for identifying the age of a leaded AP by detecting the AR.",-1,
530,"By using the exhaust algorithm and the discriminant function of variance, we obtain the optimal wavelength range of the incident light for identifying the ages of the leaded AP. It is found that in the visible light band, if we choose green light with a wavelength range of 540–540.1 nm as the incident light, the ARs distribute evenly from 28.563% to 95.013%, and the leaded AP made within the last 2000 years can be identified swiftly and precisely by detecting the ARs. This will be useful for the design of practical, fast nondestructive optical instruments for identifying the ages of leaded AP.",-1,
531,"In summary, results of in-operando HAXPES measurements are in agreement with the theoretical predictions suggesting that the materials modifications must overcome a certain threshold (i.e., critical concentration of oxygen vacan cies in the CFs) to stabilize the resistive switching phenomenon. Thus, a stable and low-power/forming-free resistive switching may be difficult to obtain when the oxygen vacancies reservoir is only based on Ti/HfO2 interface redox reactions. In other words, for forming-free Ti/HfO2/TiN RRAM cells, other oxygen defect engineering (e.g., trivalent cation doping) must be implemented. Finally, a further important result is that the defect physics in Ti/HfO2/TiN RRAM cells is not limited to oxygen vacancies. Other impurities present in HfO2 films, highlighted here by carbon, may contribute under electrical stress to the resistive switching phenomenon and, thus, influence the switching characteristics, like reliability. It is, thus, of importance to achieve a global picture of the defect physics in resistive switching HfO2-based RRAM cells in order to not only understand the physics of the switching but in particular to achieve reliable RRAM performance.",1,
532,"6. Conclusions In summary, we have proposed a rectangular 2D PhC structure to provide rather flat EFCs across the whole FBZ along the ΓX direction. The all-angle self-collimating phenomenon has been observed in this structure. By tracking the spatial evolution and transmission efficiency of the collimated beam after different propagating distance, it is found that its spreading and propagation loss are negligible for incident angles within ±85°. The differences of the self-collimation between the rectangular and square lattices have been studied. Finally, a Y-shaped beam splitter has been constructed by combining two parts of the rotated rectangular structures. Transmission efficiencies for both branches as high as 43.8% have been achieved.",12,
533,"In summary, pronounced resistive switching properties were observed in the current voltage measurements with a change of about 2 orders of magnitude in the Au/CdZnTe/ITO structures. The resistive switching may be ascribed to the polarization of CdZnTe and the Schottky contact. The conduction in the HRS depended on the following Poole–Frenkel behavior, and the conduction in the LRS depended on the carrier injection from the Au electrode. From this study, it can be concluded that CdZnTe is a promising material for applications in nonvolatile memories Further work is needed to increase the lifespan of these devices.",0,
534,"In summary, we have implemented a memristor-based optimization hardware that uses transient chaos in searching for global optimum of continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This transiently chaotic annealing is realized by gradually resetting the devices in the diagonal positions of the memristor crossbar, serving as self-feedback weights of Hopfield neurons, without introducing additional devices or circuit modules, therefore implying improved efficiency. Furthermore, the intrinsic nonlinear depression characteristics of TaOx devices can serve as an efficient and simplified annealing strategy, which can be achieved using simple pulse schemes. The potential of the transiently chaotic memristor optimizer has been experimentally demonstrated in both continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization problems, but the applicability of the approach may be extended to a large variety of optimization problems. This work could thus be of great significance for extending the capability of memristive systems from neural network accelerators to solving complex, real-world computation problems that are challenging for conventional digital computers.",3,
535,"In summary, this work presents the results of an experi- mental study directed towards understanding dielectric and resistive switching properties of 12 different PZT (40:60)/ HfO2 bilayer heterostructures grown on platinized Si sub- strates. We have varied the relative thickness of HfO2 and compared how these properties change compared to mono- lithic PZT (40:60) films grown on the same substrate under identical conditions. Our results indicate that: • Polarization switching can be maintained in bilayer films consisting of PZT (40:60) and increasing thickness of dielectric HfO2 with DE layer fractions of up to 8%. These films display robust ferroelectric properties, includ- ing a well-developed polarization- electric field hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization of up to 40 lC/cm2. There is a slight reduction in the remnant polarization ( 28%) compared to PZT (40:60). There is an increase in the coercive field in PZT (40:60)/ HfO2 samples. For PZT (40:60) films with a 20 nm HfO2 layer, the coercive field is 305 kV/cm, whereas for mono- lithic PZT (40:60), the coercive field is 100 kV/cm. The insertion of the HfO2 layer results in a drastic reduc- tion in the leakage current density. For example, leakage current density is 5.5 × 10—4 A/cm2 in a 250 nm film of PZT (40:60) compared to 8.7 × 10—4 A/cm2 in an equiva- lent film with 20 nm of HfO2. The permittivity and coercive field are described by a rela- tively simple CIS model which indicates that the PZT (40:60)/HfO2 bilayers are electrostatically decoupled, pos- sibly due to trapped/bound charges at the FE/DE interface. • Resistive switching measurements indicate that the FE film can be SET and RESET to two stable resistance states with at least an order of magnitude in resistance difference from 5 × 108 to 5 × 109 X.",17,
536,"In summary, bipolar switching of RRAM of Cu/Cu–SiO2/ TaN and Cu/Cu–SiO2/TaON/TaN was demonstrated. The intentionally introduced TaON layer between the TaN bottom electrode and the Cu–SiO2 resistor increased RHRS=RLRS ratios to above 400, and improved the endurance of cyclic resistance switching. Furthermore, the Cu/Cu– SiO2/TaON/TaN cell had low SET voltages of about +0.3 V, which is compatible with low-voltage CMOS technologies. The conduction mechanism in HRS was Schottky emission for the RRAM cell with an interfacial TaON layer, and SCLC for the cell without an interfacial oxide layer.",5,
537,We investigated the URS-forming process of Ta2O5-x thin films by studying the dependence of the electric field required for the forming process on film-thickness and ambient oxygen-pressure variations. Our results indicated that the URS-forming process was independent of changes in the film thickness nor oxygen pressure. This suggests that the URS-forming process of Ta2O5-x thin films is governed by thermally assisted dielectric breakdown within our measurement range.,56,
538,"In summary, we have grown highly oriented anatase TiO2 films with 20 nm thickness on SRO bottom electrodes. We have observed bipolar resistive switching behaviors in simple Pt/TiO2/SRO capacitor structures. All the resistive switching characteristics of our Pt/TiO2/SrRuO3 structures can be explained by memristor behavior based on locally induced ion migration.",1,
539,"In this paper, we have provided a detailed description of the device requirements needed to obtain software-equivalent training accuracies on Fully Connected DNNs. The novel weight structure we recently proposed is composed of two pairs of devices, a Most Significant Pair (MSP) and a Least Significant Pair (LSP). This concept substantially reduces device requirements by splitting the training task between the device pairs. The MSP is responsible for long-term weight storage and must be capable of rapid Closed-Loop Tuning (CLT) during weight transfer; the LSP is responsible for example-by-example weight programming and thus must be capable of rapid Open-Loop Tuning (OLT) conductance update. Figure 21 shows a table providing a summary of the quantitative device tolerance requirements obtained here, where the green boxes correspond to the most relaxed condition between MSP and LSP.",47,
540,"For the MSP, retention and stability of the conductance states, and fast, reliable conductance programming are of primary importance. Low pulse - to - pulse variability is much more important than device - to - device variability, endurance, or device yield. While the number of levels available to the MSP does not directly impact the dynamic range of the overall synapse, lower dynamic range forces a smaller F factor and thus limits the efficacy of the multiple conductances - of - varying - significance approach. The MSP does not need to support small conductance updates, although this could be helpful if the CLT procedure were modified accordingly. An ideal MSP might be one that was capable of very large but still granular conductance changes in one direction (either SET or RESET) and much smaller conductance changes in the other direction, and which exhibited this behavior at all possible conductance states.",47,
541,"In contrast, the LSP needs to offer small conductance changes with low pulse - to - pulse variability. Because the overall dynamic range of the synapse scales directly with the dynamic range of the LSP device, a large dynamic range is still desired. However, the presence of the MSP reduces the required size of this dynamic range by a factor of 8 X [from 1000 (Ref. 4) to ~110]. An LSP device needs fast programming speed for the very small conductance updates and reasonable endurance. However, the presence of MSP and the use of polarity inversion means that poor retention or high device-to-device variability is not a problem.",47,
542,"Future work will need to focus on the development of novel memory devices which target either MSP or LSP requirements. The results of this paper can be directly applied for devices capable of abrupt conductance decrease (RESET) and a conductance response which is initially steep but then saturates as conductance increases (partial SET), or for the exact opposite (e.g., abrupt SET and partial RESET). The methodology of this paper can be used for other kinds of devices offering bidirectional programming. For such devices, the CLT approach would need to be slightly redesigned to exploit the strengths (and to finesse the weaknesses) of such MSP and LSP devices.",23,
543,"The multiple - conductances - of - varying significance approach we recently introduced can eliminate the need to develop one single device that must satisfy a very demanding list of device requirements. In its place, we need two different devices, to populate a Least Significant Pair and Most Significant Pair, calling for very different yet substantially relaxed device requirements, as we have quantified in the present paper. This is an important step towards the industrial development of hardware accelerators based on analog resistive memory devices.",-1,
544,"In summary, the interface-state effects on the RS behavior of hybrid organic−inorganic perovskite were demonstrated. An interesting NDR phenomenon presented with degradation of MAPbI3 under air-exposure. More importantly, we verified that the occurrence of NDR behavior can be attributed to degradation induced interface-state, such as iodine vacancies. The trapping / detrapping of electrons in bulk defects and interface-state accounts for the NDR and bipolar RS behavior. The current work not only presents a unique NDR behavior, but also clarifies the role of interface-state in hybrid perovskite RS memories. Interface-state and chemical instability are critical issues for hybrid perovskite materials. Our study of the interface-state effects on RS behavior will help guide the development of more accurate switching mechanisms for memory applications based on hybrid organic−inorganic perovskites. Furthermore, the hybrid perovskite device also exhibits potential for applications in flexible memory.",12,
545,"In conclusion, we have proposed a pn memory diode of a p-Cu2O/SiCxOy/n-SiC/n-Si diode structure with a SiCxOy layer inserted between the p-Cu2O and n-SiC pn semiconducting layers. The forward bias current switches between high and low resistances. The results of XPS, AES, I–V, and C–V measurements suggest that the change between the high- and low-resistance states depends on the existence or nonexistence of negative charges. This change is probably induced by electrons trapped in the intermediate SiCxOy layer. The reverse current is very low owing to the selfrectifying behavior of the pn diode, regardless of whether the memory diode is in the high- or low-resistance state. This memory also exhibits good endurance characteristics of more than 105 resistance-switching cycles. Thus, the memory diode shows both resistive-nonvolatile-memory and rectifying behaviors, which are suited for the theoretically densestcross-point memory array",0,
546,"In conclusion, we demonstrate that the electrical conduction of a SrTiO3 :Cr film sandwiched between Cu bottom and Pt top electrodes is in excellent agreement with the variablerange hopping model. Both the temperature and the electricfield dependence of the current exhibit the characteristic behavior of T^−1/4 and F^−1/4, respectively. Two microscopic parameters, namely, the density of localized states at the Fermi level N(EF) and the localization parameter α, can be extracted from our experiments. It is shown that the conductivity increase during the voltage-stress-induced forming process is due to an increase of the density of states. The generation of states is explained by the creation of Sr vacancies and oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3 :Cr.",2,
547,"In conclusion, despite a lack of understanding of its physical origin in the past 50 years since its discovery, the unique thresholdswitching phenomenon observed in Se- and Te-based amorphous chalcogenides upon electrical field application has nevertheless led recently to a major technological breakthrough in the memories field. The latter enabled the advent of high-density 3D nonvolatile resistive memories because of the association of a PCM element and an OTS selector, both based on chalcogenide materials. In that context, we have shown that tailoring the amorphous structure of GS-based thin films by N and Sb incorporation produces highly performant OTS materials, as demonstrated in selector devices. Because of the investigation of amorphous structure of prototypical chalcogenide thin films coupled with analysis of their electronic properties and their OTS behavior upon electric field application, we made it possible to draw design rules to optimize further the OTS properties of amorphous chalcogenides. First, controlling the number of homopolar and wrong bonds is demonstrated to be a key parameter to control subthreshold leakage current, which is the main limitation toward an increase in crossbar array sizes in 3D memory devices, whereas controlling the bandgap of the material permits to adjust the value of the threshold voltage. Moreover, increasing the rigidity of the amorphous structure by introducing covalently bonded element such as N atoms improves the amorphous phase stability against crystallization and therefore the endurance of the OTS selector.",61,
548,"While subthreshold conduction mechanisms in CGs are now well understood with more and more accurate models to describe experimental observations, the underlying physical mechanism at play during the OTS is still highly debated. Using AIMD simulations validated by all the above experimental investigations, we have been able to relate the OTS mechanism to subtle structural rearrangements of the amorphous phase upon high electric field application. The simulated electronic excitation of the glasses results in structural reordering, with bond alignment and appearance of local structural motifs reminiscent of the MVB that has been recently described in crystalline chalcogenide phase-change materials. The latter are therefore responsible for a huge change of electronic DoS accompanied by a huge increase in electronic conductivity of the materials.",63,
549,"In addition, the present OTS model tends to establish for the first time the common link between chalcogenide materials belonging to phase-change materials and those from the OTS family. In both systems, the MVB mechanism is at the origin of the unique properties that led to the recent breakthrough in nonvolatile memory field because of the coupling of a PCM-resistive cell and of an OTS selector. As evidenced here, the main difference between phase-change materials and OTS materials can be found in their ability to stabilize the MVB mechanism and in the energy barrier to crystallization.",61,
550,"Observing in situ the structural features of OTS switching remains  a challenge. First, the limited volume of OTS material within the device requires the use of characterization techniques, which can probe areas as small as a few tens of square nanometers. Moreover, because of the use of high electrical fields, the OTS has to be triggered by electrical pulses of a few tens of nanoseconds, therefore limiting the in situ analysis to time-resolved experiments with nanosecond resolution. Nevertheless, the recent development of ultrahigh brilliance and time-resolved sources such as x-ray free electron lasers may give us the opportunity in the near future to measure the structural changes accompanying OTS by time-resolved nanoprobes. In a very recent study, a similar approach has been successfully used to evidence, for the first time, a liquid-liquid phase transition in phase-change materials by femtosecond diffraction.",63,
551,"The present experimental and simulation findings could be used to design chalcogenide materials with improved properties for applications exploiting their unique nonlinear behavior under an electric field. For instance, the unique nonlinear behavior under optical or electrical excitation could lead to the development of performant new neuromorphic devices to mimic signal processing of biological neurons beyond von Neumann computing schemes.",-1,
552,"In summary, BiFeO3 thin films have been deposited on Pt/sapphire and Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates, respectively. The Schottky contacts of the thin film on Pt/sapphire dominate the transport and help to suppress the leakage current in both voltage polarities, and the IV curve shows no hysteresis due to the reversely biased Schottky contact. However, the thin film on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si shows a diode behavior and is resistively switchable, which results from the asymmetric contact geometry at the two interfaces. By comparing the electric properties of the thin films on different substrates, the mechanism of the observed resistive switching is clari- fied to be due to an electron trapping effect.",4,
553,"We explored the dopant modulation of conductivity at 500 K for seven non-metallic dopants (C, Si, Ge, H, F, N, and B) in substoichiometric a-Ta2Ox using first-principles calculated DC electrical conductivities (ro) for 18 QMD configuration snapshots of five independent insertion sites into two previously studied19 references of aTa48O119, collectively resulting in a data set of 1260 doped configurations of a-Ta2Ox to provide a basis for statistical conclusions. We found dopant insertion into the quenched, amorphous solid, rather than the liquid melt, to be more useful in preservation of the original nearest neighbor network and also to facilitate comparison of different dopants into effectively similar oxide matrices.",35,
554,"Rather than a conventional dopant study using DFT based on formation energy calculations in idealized crystalline structures, we systematically used DFT calculations to directly calculate ro in pre- and post-doped a-Ta2Ox in statistically large populations. To elucidate possible fundamental mechanisms underlying the predicted bulk conductivities, we further analyzed the electronic and physical structures of our amorphous configurations and also employed Bader charge decomposition on our DFT results to qualitatively assess the propensity of each dopant studied to oxidize or reduce in the semiconducting oxide matrix of a-Ta2Ox.",35,
555,"For group IV doping of a-Ta2Ox, we found that increasing valence charge on the dopant atom correlated with FIG. 15. (a) Electron localization function contours overlaid with the atomistic network for (a) aTa48O119_0.750:B.0 (B dopant near VO 0 ) and (b) aTa48O119_0.2500:B.4 (B dopant far from VO 0 ). Qualitatively, blue represents regions void of e- density and red represents e- localization, while quantitative values are normalized to unity in ELF contours. The B dopant is represented by a magenta sphere. Tantalum and oxygen atoms are represented by large light-blue and small red spheres, respectively. In both panels, the amorphous supercells were arbitrarily oriented to simultaneously show both the BO3 group and the Ta trimer VO 0 center of the low ro reference using both x and y contour slices. Atom numbering is identical to Fig. 14 for comparison. 214102-16 Bondi, Fox, and Marinella J. Appl. Phys. 121, 214102 (2017) decreased ro in a-Ta2Ox, where C displayed both the most reliable quenching of a-Ta2Ox ro and also an amphoteric dopant nature by either accepting or donating charge depending on the nature of the host oxide. Not surprisingly, H- and F-doping of a-Ta2Ox yielded similar results in notably higher conductivities with the F dopant producing more robust results and also providing a better engineering solution based on the high diffusivity of H. F insertion into a-Ta2Ox results in primarily Ta-F bond chemistries and fluorine’s effectiveness in increasing ro appears correlated with the elimination of high e- charge Ta atoms that tend to enable localization of e- charge.19 Despite a large body of literature on N incorporation for doping and passivation of oxides, we found that Ndoping of a-Ta2Ox exacerbates the variation in ro we sought to minimize via dopant introduction; N insertion sampled at multiple sites actually produces a ro spread of roughly 16 orders of magnitude upon insertion into either low or high ro reference baselines. N insertion results in predominantly TaN bond chemistries, but N-O bonds were occasionally observed and correlated to outliers in ro vs. q space. Finally, we found B to be the easiest to ionize among the dopants studied and a robust way to produce high ro with minimal variation in a-Ta2Ox. B insertion into low ro a-Ta2Ox readily forms B-O bonds in BO3 groups with trigonal planar symmetry; BO3 groups are also formed from B insertion into a high ro a-Ta2Ox host oxide, but to a lesser extent. While both B and F produce high ro a-Ta2Ox, their mechanisms are likely fundamentally different. Unlike F insertion, B insertion actually results in high charge outliers on both Ta and O atoms, where the Ta outliers are mostly Ta trimer VO 0 center constituents and the O outliers are participants in BO3 groups.",35,
556,"Several device-level conclusions for ReRAM seem plausible from our ro predictions. In the case of C, our results suggest that the high-low ro range might be mediated through C insertion, resulting in a simultaneous moderation of both SET and RESET states and a decreased variation in the inherent stochasticity of the low ro RESET state. In the case of N insertion into a-Ta2Ox, our results indicate that N would be deleterious to resistive switching by increasing the variation of both the SET and RESET states and ultimately could even make SET and RESET indistinguishable if both ranges largely overlap. Despite robust, high ro from insertion of B or F into a-Ta2Ox, speculation about device effects is more difficult without further work. Clearly, consistently high ro in the RESET state prohibits device implementation; however, it is very likely that B and F dopants in a-Ta2Ox might have useful applications at lower dopant concentrations and/or other Ta2Ox stoichiometries and dynamic behavior in their oxidation states during resistive switching may also prove to be essential aspects of their ability to modulate a-Ta2Ox conductivity. Further work is required to evaluate the effects of dopant concentration, oxide stoichiometry, and oxidation state on ro in doped a-Ta2Ox.",72,
557,"Direct calculation of material properties like ro from first-principles is an intuitive approach to evaluate the effect of dopants in relatively unexplored materials and is especially useful in disordered systems in which no single defect configuration can dominate a metastable energetic landscape. We think the methodology presented and the conclusions obtained from these non-metallic dopants provide a useful guideline to help mitigate conductivity variation in resistive memories through manipulation of charge distributions in substoichiometric metal oxides by strategic selection of appropriate, site-insensitive dopants.",72,
558,"In conclusion, we have developed a magnetic field con- trollable Si–SiO2–MgO nonvolatile RS device by using large current. At the appropriate reading voltage of 8 V at room temperature, the device could switch between two states for more than 200 times. The on/off ratio is about 10. The resist- ance states can last for more than 104 s. By applying a mag- netic field perpendicular to the sample plane, the RS effect is strongly suppressed. When the magnetic field is removed, the RS effect restores. It is confirmed that the RS effect and the magnetic field effect on it come from c-Si, and MgO layer enables the nonvolatile behavior of the device. Lower stimulation current and energy consumption are expected by device miniaturization. Although the RS performance is not as good as other devices, our results suggest the potential multi-functional applications in silicon based industry.",21,
559,"Using an UHV C-AFM, we have measured current voltage, pre-breakdown negative differential resistance characteristics together with the TDDB distributions for two dielectric thicknesses. It was found that all those experimental characteristics can be consistently explained within the framework of a conductive filaments growth that can be thought as an invasive percolation mechanism. The Weibull characteristic corresponds to the distribution of the first filament that shunts the dielectric film. The Weibull distribution scale factor is proportional to the characteristic growth rate of an individual filament. The proportionality factor is a scaling power law of the number of filaments with the exponent 1Φb (b being the Weibull shape parameter). This scaling law can be used at standard device area. Moreover, it was found that, for the high fields used in our experiments, the acceleration factor is proportional to the Zener tunnelling probability. According to those facts, one can infer that holes generated by Zener effect may act as the filament growth driving force. A complete statistical model, in particular accounting for the Weibull shape factor, is feasible but is beyond the scope of this article. This will be detailed in a further work.",-1,
560,"In summary, we demonstrate abnormal unipolar RS phenomenon in Ag/SiO_2/Pt device with self-embedded Ag nanocrystal chain by low I_CC electroforming. The I-V fitting and variable temperature test results demonstrate that the abnormal unipolar RS behavior of the device is dominated by charging and discharging of electrons in Ag nanocrystals. The abnormal unipolar RS behavior shows very good uniformity and high stability. Furthermore, by controlling the stop voltage of RESET, stable multilevel resistance states can be achieved, indicating the multilevel storage potential of the device.",18,
561,"In this work, with a simple process, we have successfully synthesized PbS QD self-assembly with uniform distribution. The QDs in the NQDs are arranged in an orderly manner. For the NQD MD, we achieved a reduced threshold voltage, centralized distribution of the SET and RESET voltages, robust retention, fast response time, and low switching power consumption. We also achieved comprehensive biosynaptic functions and plasticity. In the next step, we plan to reduce the device electrode area to reduce the switching voltage dispersion performance. Based on the experimental results, the properties of MD devices were improved significantly by introducing PbS NQDs. According to TEM results, it can be found that Ag clusters approach to the PbS QDs and formation of Ag CFs. This approach could also be applied generally to other NQD MDs with different materials and structures to boost further development of artificial synapses for brain-inspired computing systems.",3,
562,"In summary, we investigated unipolar RS behaviors of Pt/NiO/Pt structures with epitaxial and polycrystalline NiO layers. The epitaxial NiO layer showed a large voltage variation for low-to-high-resistance state switching and poor reproducibility during repeated switching cycles. Firstprinciples calculation suggested that the low migration energy at the grain boundary helped to create reliable switching. This result emphasized the importance of crystalline defects in the RS phenomena of MOM structures.",29,
563,"In summary, tantalum oxide films have been grown by ALD. The composition is Ta2O5 and is uniform for the entire tantalum oxide thin films. A nano suboxide layer can be generated in the top layer of the Ta2O5 films by an Arþ ion beam irradiation. This phenomenon is induced by the exposure of Ta2O5 films to energetic radiation sources resulting in decomposition and the formation of different compounds within the radiated layer. The thickness of TaOx is controlled by the energy and irradiation time of the Arþ ion beam. According to this study, a Ta2O5/TaOx heterostructure can be controllably grown by installing an Arþ ion beam gun in the ALD chamber. This will be valuable for 3D RRAM fabrication.",-1,
564,"We have prepared MOD-derived BT thin films by layer-bylayer annealing especially in nitrogen and investigated the properties of bipolar-type resistive switching, focusing on the relationship between oxygen vacancies and the behavior of resistive hysteresis. Initially, the BT thin film with single final annealing in nitrogen showed the hysteresis of non-filament bipolar-type resistive switching with current ON=OFF ratios from 1 to 2 orders of magnitude for both bias polarities. However, the film shows a low endurance against ON=OFF switching of about 102 cycles.",14,
565,"On the other hand, the BT thin films with both pre- and final annealing in nitrogen (layer-by-layer annealing) showed the resistive hysteresis of bipolar-type switching with current ON=OFF ratios of 2 orders of magnitude for both bias polarities, with a switching endurance of 104 cycles. The endurance for pre-=final annealing in N2=N2 was improved by 2 digits compared with that in air=N2. As XPS results suggest that the number of oxygen vacancies in the films was increased by N2 annealing, it is natural to consider that the mentioned resistive change phenomenon was improved by increasing the number of oxygen vacancies in the films.",14,
566,"That is, in other words, it is possible that the non-filament bipolar-type resistive switching has origins from not only at the metal electrode=oxide interface but also the inside of the oxide films. Therefore, the oxygen vacancies inside of BT thin films would play an important role in bipolar-type resistive switching. Finally, we expect that the BT thin films would be applied to ReRAM when their endurance performance is much improved by understanding and controlling the generation of oxygen vacancies.",14,
567,"In general, the statistical distribution of time dependent failure processes which result from “weakest-link” type of effects or from physical processes that follow a Poisson distribution such as nucleation are typically described by means of the Weibull function,23,38",55,
568,"Here, F is the cumulative failure probability, t the time, s the characteristic failure or breakdown time for F ¼ 0.63 and b the slope parameter of the distribution. The slope parameter represents the slope of a straight line which is obtained by plotting ln[-ln(1 - F)] for a Weibull distribution against ln(t).",55,
569,"As shown in Eqs. (8), (9), and (11), the natural logarithm of the average nucleation and growth times, sn, sna, and sg, depends inversely on both the overpotential g and the temperature T. Therefore, according to the nucleation and growth model, one would expect a significant decrease in sn, sna, and sg with increasing voltage and temperature. We now assume that the “time-to-breakdown,” tBD, when the first current jump or first prebreakdown event is observed on a memory cell under constant voltage stress can be identified as the time required to form the first critical nucleus or to grow the bridging filament. Thus, one should expect that the Weibull characteristic failure time s will depend in the same manner on the overpotential and the temperature as sn, sna, and sg.",55,
570,"In our breakdown study, constant voltage stress measurements were performed at room temperature as well as at higher temperatures on planar capacitor structure dual layered electrolytic memory cells integrated with different Ge0.3Se0.7 active layer thicknesses and a constant buffer layer thickness of 2 nm. A maximum measurement time of 3600 s was set for all experiments and around 30 – 35 devices were used to arrive at the tBD probability distributions at particular conditions. A current jump with a change of two orders of magnitude was specified as the failure criterion throughout the study.",37,
571,"Figure 5(a) shows Weibull plots of the cumulative tBD probability distributions for memory cells with a Ge0.3Se0.7 active layer thickness of 90 nm and 50 50 lm2 cross-sectional area, at different constant voltage stresses. All the corresponding breakdown experiments were performed at room temperature. The Weibull slope parameters were calculated by least-square fits of the cumulative tBD probability distributions with a confidence level of 95%. They do not show any clear dependence on the applied voltage stress value in our study.",37,
572,"We found Weibull slope parameters of b ¼ 0.72, 0.81, 1.05, 0.96, and 0.65 for constant voltage stresses of V ¼ 180, 200, 220, 240, and 260 mV, respectively. The slope parameter is an important factor in reliability analysis. A low value of the slope parameter (<1) indicates more spread in the distribution, which is not desirable from an application point of view. The physical reasons for the observed b < 1 values are not fully understood yet, but these results might be attributed to film thickness non-uniformity and to some extent to the small number of devices used for estimating b values in this statistical study. Further studies including an area dependence analysis (as shown below) are needed to cross-check these discrepancies.",37,
573,"Despite the observed randomness in b, one clearly sees from Fig. 5(a) that the characteristic breakdown time s, as expected, decreases with increasing voltage stress across the memory cells. Figure 5(b) depicts ln(s) as a function of the applied voltage stress. Considering the overpotential g, as a first approximation, to be equal to the applied voltage stress V, the observed linear behavior of ln(s) vs V indicates that our breakdown statistics is consistent with the critical nucleus formation or filament growth concept as expected from Eqns. (9) and (11). From the slope of the curve, we obtained With T ¼ 300 K, one gets a 2.7=z. As mentioned earlier, in case of electrochemical reactions, the cathodic charge transfer coefficient lies always in the range 0 < a < 1. Even if we assume z ¼ 2, we do not get any realistic value for a. We thus believe that the nucleation process rather than the filament growth process governs the characteristic break down time in our memory cells for the voltage range used in this study.",38,
574,"According to the atomistic nucleation model, we thus have n ¼ (a þ Ncrit) ¼ 2.7=z. Using a 0.5 for the direct charge transfer case and z ¼ 1, we find Ncrit 2.2, i.e., the critical nucleus consists of approximately 2–3 atoms in the voltage interval 0.18 – 0.26 V.",-1,
575,"Next, we have used the classical nucleation model to roughly estimate the critical Gibbs nucleation energy, DGcrit, and critical nucleus size, Ncrit. Figure 5(c) presents the experimental data for the characteristic breakdown time s in a ln(s) vs 1=V2 plot. An analysis based on Eqs. (8), (5a), and (5b) shows that, in the studied voltage stress interval of 0.18 – 0.26 V, DGcrit varies between 0.40 and 0.19 eV, while Ncrit varies between 4.4 and 1.5. It is important to point out that the number of atoms comprising the critical nucleus at 0.22 V, Ncrit 2.1, agrees well for both the classical and atomistic treatments. This indicates that both equations, the classical Eq. (8) and the atomistic Eq. (9), coincide in the high overpotential region, but that the value of Ncrit is too small to make the classical treatment acceptable. However, going to lower overpotentials where the critical nucleus is sufficiently large, a classical representation could be more informative.35,36",38,
576,"Recently, Russo et al. 39 have studied the voltage dependence of the programming time for the “ON resistance switching” on a comparable system, Ag doped Ge-S (active layer thickness 60 nm). For applied cell voltages >0.4 V, they found a clear exponential decrease of the programming or switching time with increasing voltage. Based upon a fit of their experimental data and the resulting fit parameters, Russo et al. 39 suppose that at voltages >0.4 V the programming speed might be controlled by an electrochemical reaction like charge transfer or by ion migration processes. At voltages <0.4 V, however, considerable deviations were found (see Fig. 6 in Ref. 39) which could not simply be explained by a charge transfer or ion migration model. These findings might indicate that at lower applied voltages another process starts to dictate the overall switching behavior and it is reasonable to assume that nucleation processes might come into play. Generally, as the nucleation, charge transfer and ion migration rate have a different exponential dependence on the applied voltage, one can expect a transition from a charge transfer or ion migration to a nucleation controlled filament formation within a certain voltage range.",-1,
577,"In the previous section, information about DGcrit and Ncrit has been obtained from the voltage dependence of the characteristic breakdown time s. As a test of the robustness of our nucleation model, these values have to be compared with results from the temperature dependence of the characteristic breakdown time.",38,
578,"Therefore, we have investigated the tBD probability distributions under a constant voltage stress of 120 mV at diffferent temperatures for 90 nm Ge0.3Se0.7 films integrated in planar structures with 50 50 lm2 cross-sectional area. The Cu top electrode was covered with a 30 nm sputtered Pt film to prevent oxidation at higher temperatures. Figure 6(a) shows Weibull plots of the cumulative distributions of the measured tBD for different temperatures. As expected, the characteristic time s decreases with increasing temperature. DGcrit was calculated from the Arrhenius plot of ln(s) vs 1=T as shown in Fig. 6(b) and was found to be around 0.71 eV. Extrapolating to V ¼ 0.22 V, one finds by means of Eq. 5(a) DGcrit ¼ 0.71 eV* (0.12 V)2 = (0.22 V)2 0.21 eV, a value which is in good agreement with that calculated from the voltage dependence.",37,
579,"Using Eq. 5(b) with DGcrit ¼ 0.71 eV, z ¼ 1 and V ¼ 0.12 V, we assess Ncrit to be approximately 12 atoms. In case the critical nucleus has the form of a hemisphere and considering that the atoms are closely packed, the diameter of this hemisphere will be around 1 nm. This calculated diameter of the critical nucleus might give a rough estimation of the minimum feature size of filaments formed in these memory cells during the prebreakdown process.",38,
580,"Thus, from the above discussion, at least for the voltage range used in this study, both the voltage and temperature dependence of the characteristic breakdown times and the derived values for the involved physical quantities strongly indicate that nucleation dominates the “ON resistance switching” speed. However, one can expect a crossover from nucleation to a growth rate limited switching within a certain voltage range varying for different material systems.",38,
581,"The high scaling possibilities of RRAM based future non-volatile memories is one of the main driving forces behind the growing scientific and technological interests.15 Though we have qualitatively estimated the size of the filament based on a nucleation model which is quite promising from the scalability point of view, it is still too early to predict the scalability of RRAM based memory devices as long as the various fundamental issues related to these memory devices such as underlying switching mechanism,15 reliability26 and noise properties40 are not addressed thoroughly. In the literature, breakdown analysis is commonly used as a unique tool to investigate the scaling effects on device reliability and performance.20–24 Hence, not only to verify the compatibility of the proposed nucleation model, but also from the device reliability point of view, it becomes important to investigate the thickness and area dependencies of the tBD probability distributions on Cu doped Ge0.3Se0.7 solid electrolyte based memory devices.",-1,
582,"Figure 7(a) shows Weibull plots of the cumulative tBD probability distributions for Ge0.3Se0.7 films with thicknesses ranging from 30 to 120 nm. The measurements were performed at room temperature by applying a constant voltage stress of 180 mV on memory cells with 50 50 lm2 cross-sectional area. As can be seen, the Weibull slope parameter b is approximately the same for memory devices with different thicknesses. The characteristic breakdown time increases exponentially with increasing the thickness of integrated Ge0.3Se0.7 thin film as shown in Fig. 7(b).",37,
583,"Given that, based on the above discussion, the classical nucleation model accounts fairly well for the randomness observed in our breakdown study, one is then left with the question of a possible physical explanation for the dependence of the characteristic breakdown time on the integrated thickness of the active material. Though the exact physical explanation is yet not clear, there are some possible reasons for this observation.",55,
584,"On the one hand, one has to take into account that Cu doped Ge0.3Se0.7 is an inhomogeneous material system. As in the case of Ag doped Se-rich GexSe1-x, 16 Cu doped Ge0.3Se0.7 probably consists of nanosized, mixed ionic-electronic conducting Cu2Se precipitates which are separately dispersed in a continuous, high-resistivity Ge-rich GeSe matrix (cf. Fig. 4). Under polarizing conditions, the electric field will distribute in a complex manner inside the Cu doped Ge-Se film owing both to inhomogeneous local electronic and ionic conductivities and to the inner surfaces that can give rise to the build-up of space charge regions. It is thus reasonable to assume that the average voltage drop at the interface Pt cathode=electrolyte which establishes the overpotential might be only a fraction of the externally applied voltage. In case this fraction decreases with increasing film thickness, one would expect some exponential dependence of the characteristic breakdown time on film thickness. Under this point of view, the values for the critical nucleus size as determined in sections (A) and (B) should be regarded as minimum limiting values.",-1,
585,"On the other hand, we believe that direct electric field effects on the nucleation process could be another possible reason for the observed thickness dependence. This is particularly important in case of thin film material systems, such as our memory devices, where the strong electric field across the memory cell could significantly influence the nucleation process and, hence, the resistive switching process. The high electric field E across the growing nucleus, in addition to the applied overpotential, could further increase the nucleation probability by suppressing the nucleation barrier through the decrease in the electrostatic energy FE and could thus contribute significantly to the free energy change for the formation of stable nuclei. Considering the electric field effect, Eq. (4) can be generalized as",38,
586,"Field induced nucleation becomes dominant when the decrease in DG(N) owing to FE exceeds the contribution of the supersaturation. Following the approach of the high field induced nucleation model for threshold switching behavior in PCRAM, as proposed by Kaprov et al., 41,42 the nucleation time varies as where (DGcrit)0 is the classical critical Gibbs nucleation energy and E0 is a characteristic electric field. E should be approximately related to the external voltage V and film thickness L such as E V=L.",38,
587,"In principle, this model explains very well the observed exponential dependence of the characteristic breakdown time on the thickness of integrated Ge0.3Se0.7 thin film, as shown in Fig. 7(b). However, we know that (DGcrit)0 itself depends on the overpotential. Therefore, within this model, it becomes difficult to distinguish between an electric field and overpotential dominated nucleation on base of the data presented. Further analysis at low electric field strengths could shed more light to make a distinction between these two regimes.",38,
588,"As shown above, nucleation and thus the ensuing breakdown events obey a statistical distribution which can be analyzed according to Weibull statistics. One property of the Weibull function F is that F should scale with the electrode area A of the devices if the nucleation sites are randomly distributed on the electrode:23",55,
589,"From this equation it follows that if the area is increased by a factor (A0 =A) then the tBD probability distribution shifts vertically by ln(A0 =A) along the Weibull scale and the characteristics time s decreases to s0 , according to23",55,
590,"By measuring the tBD distribution functions on devices with different areas, one can verify whether the nucleation sites are randomly distributed. To check this property, we investigated the influence of the memory device cross-sectional area on the tBD probability distributions. The measurements were performed at room temperature under a constant voltage stress of 200 mV on memory devices with a 90 nm Ge0.3Se0.7 film. Figure 8(a) shows the cumulative tBD distribution for different electrode areas ranging from 50 50 to 400 400 lm2 . As can be seen, there is a clear shift vertically along the Weibull scale with increasing device area. Further, the power law dependence of s on area [Eq. (17)] can be used to extract a more exact value for the slope parameter b rather than using a linear fit of a single Weibull distribution. Figure 8(b) shows the linear dependence of ln(s0 =s) on ln (A=A0 ) according to Eq. (17). The calculated value of b is found to be 1, which indicates that the breakdown process in our memory cells is of intrinsic nature. Indeed, in the future, this approach has to be followed to carefully cross-check the observed randomness of the Weibull slope parameters as found in the present breakdown study on Ge0.3Se0.7 based memory cells.",37,
591,"In summary, the “ON resistance switching” statistics was studied to understand the stochastic nature of the resistance switching behavior of Cu doped Ge0.3Se0.7 based memory devices. Based upon an analysis of the voltage and temperature dependence of the characteristic switching time, the observed switching statistics was found to be related to the stochastic nature of underlying nucleation processes which induce the formation of the conducting filament. For the voltage range used in this study, we obtained a critical Gibbs nucleation energy in the range 0.71 0.22 eV, corresponding to a number of atoms forming the critical nucleus in the range 12 – 2.3. A linear dependence of the characteristic breakdown time on the film thickness probably indicates that an electric field effect needs to be considered in addition to overpotential driven nucleation.",-1,
592,"At the end, though our breakdown analysis on Cu doped Ge0.3Se0.7 based memory cells indicates that “ON resistance switching” is governed by nucleation effects, yet there are some critical points which need to be considered in future to improve our understanding. First, the influence of the disorder on nucleation and, hence, on the fluctuations in device performance is not included in the proposed model. To be precise, disorder can come into play in many ways during the resistive switching process. The switching process enhances an initially present disorder through the nucleation of new local conductive paths and branches or, simply, due to the heterogeneity of the electric field stress that results from the complex geometrical rearrangement of existing local conductive paths. Even a small initially present disorder in the material systems can be enormously amplified during switching. Additionally, the enormous statistical fluctuations in the electrical field in disordered material systems could easily lead to enormous statistical fluctuations in the time required for “ON resistance switching.”",65,
593,"Second, in our analysis, we have not considered the lateral growth of the filament after the first prebreakdown event (see Fig. 2), the dynamics of which could be important for a further understanding of the retention behavior of these memory cells.",-1,
594,"Third, for industrial applications, these memory devices should display fast (ns-scale) writing speed. In this time scale, all the processes discussed above, i.e., ion migration, nucleation and filament growth, could play an essential role in the switching behavior. Hence, it becomes important to distinguish between the rate limiting processes for reliable and fast switching memory devices.",0,
595,"Finally, although the approach used in this article provides a route to understand the stochastic nature of the resistive switching behavior, the above mentioned critical points highlight some of the challenges ahead for developing reliable RRAM based memory devices for future applications.",6,
596,"To conclude, this paper reported stable and repeatable URS and BRS characteristics and switching mechanisms in a Cu/GeOx/W memory structure. A crystalline conical-type Cu nanofilament was observed using HRTEM and FFT analysis. The diameter of the Cu nanofilament increased linearly from 0.13 A˚ to 25 nm at CCs of 1 nA to 10 mA, which were also calculated using the other approach. The memory device shows good data retention characteristics (>10^4 s) with a high resistance ratio of 10^2 – 10^5 for the BRS mode (CCs of 1 nA to 50 µA) and 109 for the URS mode. A high resistance ratio of >104 for more than 200 h retention time at a CC of 50 lA is also observed. Therefore, a maximum nonvolatile memory size of 5000 Pbit/in2 can be obtained in future nanoscale high-density nonvolatile memory applications.",0,
597,"In summary, we fabricated inorganic lead-free resistive switching memory devices based on CsBi3I10. A uniform film was formed via CsI-rich precursor solution and a simple antisolvent-assisted solution method. The fabricated device showed nonvolatile, reproducible, and reliable bipolar resistive switching behavior with reasonable on/off ratio of 103, data retention time (104 s), and endurance (150 cycles). These performances remained for over 2 months, and the CsBi3I10 films were observed with no obvious changes in both optical properties and surface morphologies when the device was stored under ambient condition at 25 °C and 60% relative humidity. This study demonstrates that CsBi3I10 has the potential to be used for ReRAM applications for long-term work and even under humid conditions. This work provides an approach to achieve applications of inorganic bismuth-based perovskites in information storage.",12,
598,"In summary, the chemical states of Cu ions in resistanceswitching devices with a Pt/CuO/Pt structure were mapped using the PEEM in combination with the synchrotronradiation source. It was revealed that the low-resistance bridge structures were formed by the reduction in the CuO channel that occurred as a result of the forming process, and the conductive reduction path was responsible for resistance switching. In contrast, no chemical changes within the experimental resolution were observed during resistance switching, implying that the formation/rupture of the conductive reduction path occurred only at local points in the bridge structure. In order to understand the mechanism of resistance switching, a microspectroscopic analysis with a higher spatial resolution is necessary.",9,
599,"In summary, we have demonstrated nonvolatile phasechange memory using In2Se3 nanowire as programmable element. A resistance switching ratio of 105 has been obtained and the nanowire memory reversibly switches at much reduced input power/energy compared with the reported In2Se3 thin-film memory. The power needs are also lower than those for GT and GST nanowire devices. The results indicate that In2Se3 nanowire can be an excellent candidate for applications in nonvolatile data storage. Moreover, phase-change nanowire memory potentially allows very-low-power information storage through physical geometry scaling.",-1,
600,"In summary, a ReRAM device with an adjustable resistance ratio was realized by modifying the defect types in LixZn_1-xO films. The composition of LixZn_1-xO films affects the type and total number of defects. The resistance ratio of the Pt/Li0.06Zn0.94O/Pt structure was up to 10^8 . The dominant conduction mechanisms of the LRS and the HRS of the device were Ohmic behavior and PF emission, respectively. The coefficient r of the PF emission was calculated to verify the variation of the total number of defects in LixZn_1-xO films. The large resistance ratio and bistable performance of the ReRAM device might increase endurance for NVM applications.",44,
601,"A nonlinearity factor a determines how many word lines (N) and bit lines in implemented memory arrays to ensure that there is sufficient read margin. For higher a, more number of word lines can be fulfilled in a square array. Fig. 5 illustrates the leakage current path in cross-array at read voltage (Vread) and the equivalent circuit of the worse case (all unselected cells in ON state). The nonlinearity factor a can be expressed as F=R ratio, where F/R ratio is I 1þRON forward at V read/be expressed as F=R ratio, where F/R ratio is I 1þRON forward at V read/ Ireverse at —V read RF is the LRS resistance of the RRAM cell and RF is the resistance of the diode at forward bias, the higher F/R ratio is required to obtain a higher a. However, value of the R ON/RF cannot be too small. If RON is considerably smaller than RF, RF is in series with RON, leading to a significantly increase in VOFF at the constant IOFF. When RON is considerably larger than RF, a is extremely suppressed. According to above reasons, an adequate RON/RF ratio and a high F/R ratio are necessary to perform well RS characteristics and can be applied in high density memory arrays, respectively.",6,
602,"The bipolar RS mechanism of the Pt/HfO2/TiN device is proposed to be related to the formation/rupture of the conducting filament near the interface between HfO2 and TiN layers. However, by inserting a ZrO2 layer in the Pt/HfO2/ TiN device, the unipolar RS behavior is revealed that the conducting filament forms/ruptures within the HfO2 layer due to its narrower filament. For 1D1R structure, a Pt/IZO/ CoO/Pt/TiN oxide diode exhibits a sufficient IF and a good F/R ratio. Integrating the Pt/HfO2/TiN device into 1D1R structure, there is no RS characteristics because RR is significantly larger than ROFF during ON process. Pt/ZrO2/HfO2/ TiN with 1D1R structure exhibits continuous and stable RS behaviors. For retention characteristics and nondestructive readout properties, both ON and OFF states remain stable at both RT and 85 ○C. A higher F/R ratio and a suitable RON/RF ratio achieve a large a and cause well RS behaviors, respectively.",1,
603,"In conclusion, despite a lack of understanding of its physical origin in the past 50 years since its discovery, the unique thresholdswitching phenomenon observed in Se- and Te-based amorphous chalcogenides upon electrical field application has nevertheless led recently to a major technological breakthrough in the memories field. The latter enabled the advent of high-density 3D nonvolatile resistive memories because of the association of a PCM element and an OTS selector, both based on chalcogenide materials. In that context, we have shown that tailoring the amorphous structure of GS-based thin films by N and Sb incorporation produces highly performant OTS materials, as demonstrated in selector devices. Because of the investigation of amorphous structure of prototypical chalcogenide thin films coupled with analysis of their electronic properties and their OTS behavior upon electric field application, we made it possible to draw design rules to optimize further the OTS properties of amorphous chalcogenides. First, controlling the number of homopolar and wrong bonds is demonstrated to be a key parameter to control subthreshold leakage current, which is the main limitation toward an increase in crossbar array sizes in 3D memory devices, whereas controlling the bandgap of the material permits to adjust the value of the threshold voltage. Moreover, increasing the rigidity of the amorphous structure by introducing covalently bonded element such as N atoms improves the amorphous phase stability against crystallization and therefore the endurance of the OTS selector.",61,
604,"While subthreshold conduction mechanisms in CGs are now well understood with more and more accurate models to describe experimental observations, the underlying physical mechanism at play during the OTS is still highly debated. Using AIMD simulations validated by all the above experimental investigations, we have been able to relate the OTS mechanism to subtle structural rearrangements of the amorphous phase upon high electric field application. The simulated electronic excitation of the glasses results in structural reordering, with bond alignment and appearance of local structural motifs reminiscent of the MVB that has been recently described in crystalline chalcogenide phase-change materials. The latter are therefore responsible for a huge change of electronic DoS accompanied by a huge increase in electronic conductivity of the materials.",63,
605,"In addition, the present OTS model tends to establish for the first time the common link between chalcogenide materials belonging to phase-change materials and those from the OTS family. In both systems, the MVB mechanism is at the origin of the unique properties that led to the recent breakthrough in nonvolatile memory field because of the coupling of a PCM-resistive cell and of an OTS selector. As evidenced here, the main difference between phase-change materials and OTS materials can be found in their ability to stabilize the MVB mechanism and in the energy barrier to crystallization.",61,
606,"Observing in situ the structural features of OTS switching remains a challenge. First, the limited volume of OTS material within the device requires the use of characterization techniques, which can probe areas as small as a few tens of square nanometers. Moreover, because of the use of high electrical fields, the OTS has to be triggered by electrical pulses of a few tens of nanoseconds, therefore limiting the in situ analysis to time-resolved experiments with nanosecond resolution. Nevertheless, the recent development of ultrahigh brilliance and time-resolved sources such as x-ray free electron lasers may give us the opportunity in the near future to measure the structural changes accompanying OTS by time-resolved nanoprobes. In a very recent study , a similar approach has been successfully used to evidence, for the first time, a liquid-liquid phase transition in phase-change materials by femtosecond diffraction.",63,
607,"The present experimental and simulation findings could be used to design chalcogenide materials with improved properties for applications exploiting their unique nonlinear behavior under an electric field. For instance, the unique nonlinear behavior under optical or electrical excitation could lead to the development of performant new neuromorphic devices to mimic signal processing of biological neurons beyond von Neumann computing schemes.",-1,
608,"In conclusion, we have observed a self-rectifying RRAM based on a single metal-organic material FJU-23-H2O with the switched hydrogen bond pathway. The voltage-gated proton-conducting behavior in FJU-23-H2O has been confirmed. The device exhibits an ultralow set voltage (~0.2 V), a high ON/OFF ratio (~105), and a high rectification ratio (~105), which is beneficial to reducing energy consumption, to simplifying signal amplifying circuit, and to alleviating sneak path issue in the device. By SCXRD, we demonstrate that the switching mechanism of FJU-23-H2O is attributed to the turn ON/OFF of the chiral proton channels with the switched hydrogen bond pathway under the stimulus of dc voltages, establishing the unambiguous role of metal-organic solid-state ionics in the conducting device.",48,
609,"Understanding CC-NDR due to Joule heating in TiO2 thin films is not only important technologically for preparing and operating nano-memristors, but it also provides an excellent opportunity for the further understanding of small polaron properties. Our analytical model based on polaron conduction and Newton’s Law of Cooling explains the CCNDR that represents the initial stage of electroforming in TiO2 memristors as well as the heating required for the SET operation of a unipolar memristor and also provides an internal thermometer that can be used to determine the internal temperature of the device up to the limit of applicability of the model.",28,
610,"It was shown that combination of C-AFM writing and SEM is a powerful method for analyzing ReRAM filaments by enabling three-dimensional resistance visualization. Specifically, it was found that resistance-change effect induced by C-AFM writing is brought about by exchanging oxygen with the atmosphere at the surface of the NiO film. That is, low-resistance state (LRS) is brought about by introducing oxygen from the atmosphere into the surface of the NiO film at the AFM-tip/NiO film interface; on the contrary, highresistance state (HRS) is brought about by releasing oxygen to the atmosphere from the surface of the NiO film at the AFM-tip/NiO film interface. As a result, the LRS area is ptype Ni_(1+δ)O(δ < 0), whereas the HRS area is insulating or n-type Ni_(1+δ)O(δ >= 0). The proposed method will be established as a more reliable analysis by utilizing Monte Carlo electron-trajectory simulation, which obtains the size of the interaction volume and secondary radiation products as a function of specimen and beam parameters.",29,
611,"In summary, we first introduce a photonic RRAM based on CsPbBr3 QDs, a typical all-inorganic perovskite material with outstanding optoelectronic properties and preferable stability. The pristine inorganic perovskite QD-based RRAM is more competitive compared with HOIP-based RRAM due to its high reproducibility and stability. Moreover, larger ON/OFF ratio and multilevel data storage were obtained by a combination of bias voltage and photoirradiation, and the stored data can be encrypted by UV light. In addition, FE-SEM and EDX analyses were utilized to study the switching mechanism of all-inorganic perovskite QD-based RRAM. From the analysis of elemental distributions in the CsPbBr3 QDs’ film at LRS, formation and annihilation of metal conductive filament and Br- ion vacancy filament driven by the external electric field and light irradiation can lead to pronounced resistive switching effects. The photonic RRAM-gate FET, which displays analogous functions of flash memory, is further demonstrated by coupling CsPbBr3 QD-based RRAM with the p-channel transistor. The synergistic effect of electrochemical metallization and valence change in all-inorganic perovskite QDbased photonic resistive memory may help gain insight into practical logic circuit application of perovskite materials.",12,
612,"In conclusion, we achieved a CMOS-compatible and low-power volatile atomic switch serving as TS for steepslope FETs. Our results revealed that thin stoichiometric Cu2S films in a small-sized device enabled low leakage currents and low operating voltages. As a result, an ASFET comprised of the atomic switch and transistor demonstrated an SS of 5 mV/dec and a low leakage current (IOFF 105 lA/lm) driven by a low operating voltage condition (VDD 0.25 V), which is beneficial for low-power logic applications.",41,
613,"For the applications of next generation NVM devices, RRAM cells are studied to overcome the physical limitations of traditional Flash memory devices. The electrical properties of RRAM devices using MgO thin films were investigated in this work. Nonpolar resistance switching behavior is found in the Pt/MgO/Pt structure. Under the condition of Icomp ≧ 0.5 mA in SET processes, the LRS resistances and the RESET currents will reach their minimum and maximum, respectively. The current transportation in MgO films is dominated by the hopping conduction and the Ohmic conduction in HRS and LRS, respectively. Accordingly, the trap spacing and the trap energy levels were obtained in HRS. In addition, the Fermi level as well as the temperaturedependent electron mobility and effective density of states in conduction band in MgO were also obtained.",70,
614,"In summary, a detailed electrical characterization study of the conduction mechanism at different resistive levels of the Pt/TiO2x/Pt stack was presented. These levels were attained via a pulsing-based compliance-free forming protocol. The analysis of the temperature dependence for each branch of the I-V switching characteristics of the various resistive levels provides deeper insights into the underlying switching mechanism, and two major regimes were identified. For higher resistive levels, the transport in both HRS and LRS was found to be interface controlled. For the lower resistive level, the transport diverges from the interface to the core-material controlled mechanism for HRS and LRS, respectively. This study supports the argument that bespoke modification of the interface barrier can be obtained, rendering TiO2 based RRAM as more suitable and reliable for emerging applications.",24,
615,"In conclusion, we investigated the switching phenomena of MIM structures comprising Alq3, NPB, and TPBi and found a reversible threshold switching independent of the organic semiconductor material. We showed that threshold switching is a result of the chosen device structure and is suppressed in MI-n-M devices, where a doped organic layer is inserted between organic semiconductor and metal top electrode. C-f and phase-V measurements revealed a change in the phase and parallel resistance at the transition from OFF to ON state in the MIM structures at Vth. At this voltage the phase changes from capacitive to resistive behavior which corresponds to a change in the charge transport mechanism. For voltages between 0V and Vth, the electric field drops at the interface and creates an interface dipole which result in poor charge injection from the interface. This interface dipole is absent in MI-n-M structures, where no switching is observed and charge injection is not limited. At Vth, the phase changes abruptly to a resistive charge transport in the MIM structure. The charge transport is provided by the formation of localized conduction channels that originate at the interface between organic semiconductor and top metal electrode. The unavoidable incorporation of metallic particles into the upper layers of the organic material during evaporation of the metallic top electrode creates a rough interface. This mechanism explains why switching is observed in Alq3, TPBi, and NPB MIM devices. Since this switching effect strongly depends on the conditions of the interface, which in turn are hard to determine in advance, the yield of working devices is low.",-1,
616,"In conclusion, low-temperature phases in LPCMO with enormously different resistance values _x0001_differing by _x0006_105 can be repeatedly switched by applying voltage pulse. In addition, the resistance value of each phase is highly repeatable through cycling and also stable with time. These behaviors are associated with the intriguing hysteresis in the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases shown in the V-T phase diagram, and can be utilized for cryogenic memory applications, which can facilitate low-T electronics technologies. We also found that phases with intermediate resistance values can be repeatedly induced and switched back to an insulating or metallic phase by applying appropriate voltage pulses, which can be exploited for multilevel memory devices. For future applications, optimization of, e.g., chemical composition and sample architecture shall be required to maximize the phase switching speed and phase stability",0,
617,"We report on kinetic Monte-Carlo calculations of resistive switching and the underlying growth dynamics of conductive filaments in electrochemical metalization devices consisting of a Ag/TiO2/Pt sandwich-like thin film system. The developed model is not limited to i) fast time scale dynamics and ii) only one growth and dissolution cycle of metallic filaments. In particular, the presented results from the simulation of consecutive cycles are in excellent agreement with experimentally obtained data. Most importantly, we also find an unexpected filament growth mode that is in contradiction to the widely acknowledged picture of filament growth from the inert electrode toward the active electrode but consistent with recently published experimental findings. We observe filaments that start growing from the active electrode toward the inert electrode.",58,

619,"In summary, nonvolatile memory devices with (AgI)0.5(AgPO3)0.5 nanocrystalline films were fabricated. The resistance ratio between the OFF state and the ON state reaches 1 × 10^6, which makes the stored states in the memory units effectively distinguishable. 4 × 10^5 times of the write-read-erase-read operation cycles has been realized for the Ag/(AgI)0.5(AgPO3)0.5/Pt memory units without failure. The low amplitudes of the writing and erasing pulses and the short writing and erasing intervals promise the Ag /(AgI)0.5(AgPO3)0.5/Pt memory devices a candidate for the nonvolatile memory device of next generation.",-1,
620,"Although known for many years, SnS2 is a less studied binary compound compared to other materials from the same family—transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2 or WS2. In this paper, we have shown a SnS2-based photomemristor device driven by the sun, which is based on a novel hysteretic mechanism valid in thick samples of strongly anisotropic conducting materials. The obtained results show that the current and the conductance are strongly dependent on the light power and the number of voltage sweeps (pulses) applied on the device. Being abun- dant in nature, SnS2 could also be a green electronic solution for neuromorphic photonics,18 which is a new, emerging area of research oriented towards artificial neuronal net- works. Because solid-state miniaturized memristors able to respond to optical stimuli are scarcely treated in the litera- ture, this paper suggests that SnS2 multi-layered samples could be used to implement an all-optical neuromorphic cir- cuit based on artificial neurons and synapses, which have similar functionalities to memristors. In this way, optical 12 neuronal networks oriented to learning algorithms of living organisms could be implemented optically in SnS2-based devices.",47,
621,"In summary, Si-based memristive devices were successfully constructed on plastic through our new top-down route. The devices showed excellent memory characteristics and flexibility, such as intrinsic hysteric and rectifying behaviors, on/off resistance ratio of >1x10^5, retention time of > 1x10^3 s, and durability for up to 1000 bending cycles.The Ag-filament-related nanostructures were carefully analyzed to explore the switching mechanism by TEM, SIMS, and the tunneling-current model.It is suggested that the Ag nanocrystals, embedded in the a-Si layer during the fabrication process, act as an electrical path, and this nanostructure is well matched with the intrinsic resistanceswitching behavior.The nonuniform Ag profile is continuously changed according to the bias conditions, and Ag electromigration, in the region of several nanometers only, determines the device performance.These results can help us to gain an understanding about the correlation among the nanostructure, memory/ switching mechanism, and device performance for various memristive systems.Furthermore, our study suggests the promising potential of Si-based memristive systems as future flexible nonvolatile memory devices.",-1,
622,"In summary, the Ag/TiO /Nb:SrTiO /Ag device exhibits the pronounced electric field-induced magnetization modula- tion, accompanied with the bipolar resistive switching during the set and reset processes. The bipolar resistive switching in Ag/TiO2/Nb:SrTiO3/Ag device may be dominated by the mod- ulation of Schottky-like barrier with the electron injection- trapped/detrapped process at the interface of TiO2/Nb:SrTiO3. We propose that the electric field-induced magnetization mod- ulation results mainly from the creation/annihilation of lots of oxygen vacancies in TiO2. It is possible to achieve four logic states by encoding information via both magnetic manipulation and resistive switching.",10,
623,In this Comment we have demonstrated that the explanation provided by Liu et al. of the observed phenomena of filament formation and dissolution in the system Ag(Cu)/ZrO2 /Pt is not appropriate. We also offer a possible explanation that might explain the results. We point out that our considerations and discussion of this alternative explanation are based on the results presented by Liu et al. and partially supported by our own electrical measurements in the system Cu/TiO2 /Pt. A detailed study is clearly necessary to gain more detailed insight into the observed phenomena.,18,
624,"In conclusion, we explored the additional bipolar resistive switching features (CCW switching) of both Pt/Ta2O5—x/TiOxNy and Pt/Ta2O5—x/TiN samples under a particular bias condition. The I-V characteristics, along with various structural confirmations, indicated that this CCW switching might be related to the oxygen ion accumulation at interfaces between the active layer and bottom electrode. In particular, the Pt/Ta2O5—x/TiOxNy sample displayed the dis-tinct dual-resistive switching, demonstrating that the TiOxNy bottom electrode crucially serves as an oxygen barrier in a low voltage region (V < VCW set). The TiOxNy bottom elec- trode simultaneously functions as an oxygen reservoir in a high voltage region (V > VCW set) and thereby provides a typ- ical CW switching event.",56,
625,"A sintering window for Ag2S nanoparticle films has been demonstrated between 400 ℃ and 500 ℃, limited by encapsulant desorption at low temperature and material decomposition at high temperature. Other sintered nanoparticle electrolytes will likely be similarly constrained. Filament formation has been observed in these sintered nanoparticle films, demonstrating viability of application in ECM RRAM cells. The observation of filament formation in lateral structures fabricated using sintered nanoparticle films indicates that the applied voltage affects the filament morphology and subsequent operation of memory devices.",24,
626,"In conclusion, we demonstrate that by forming a novel MoS2/polymer heterostructure through interface engineering processes, we realize thin ReRAM devices with excellent switching performance. The sputtering deposition and the low temperature process for the heterostructure have the potential to be scaled up for mass production, and can also be applied to arbitrary substrates, thus offering a versatile platform for device applications such as flexible ReRAM devices or transparent electronics. Due to the outstanding device stability during C2C operation, we further show that following a non-binary statistical analysis, the HRS is an ideal source of noncorrelated data that can be distributed into multi-states while preserving a uniform distribution. These are major requirements for hardware-based TRNGs. Therefore, our work also paves a way to establish state-of-the-art memory cells with high performance for enhanced security applications in the era of big data.",0,
627,"In conclusion, the influence of Ti doping on resistive switching behaviors in Yb2O3-based resistive random access memory has been investigated. The resistive switching characteristics of Ni/Ti:Yb2O3/TaN memory device depend on the Ti-dopant concentration in oxide film. The resistive switching behavior changes from bipolar to unipolar resistive switching as the Ti atomic concentration in the Ti:Yb2O3 film changes to higher value. The driving mechanism of different resistance switching behaviors can be attributed to different chemical compositions of the filament through the oxide. The reset process in the bipolar memory devices is attributed to the annihilation of oxide defects in the oxide film, whereas the disruption of filament through Joule heating effect is responsible for unipolar resistive switching devices. Furthermore, the high Ti content in the Yb2O3 memory device exhibits improved electrical performances including reduced set/reset voltage and good endurance and retention characteristics.",16,
628,"In summary, we fabricated polycrystalline ALD STO films. The ALD STO films were synthesized by alternating ALD SrO cycles and ALD TiO2 cycles with a ratio of 1:1. The as-deposited film appeared to be Sr-rich and amorphous, and this was confirmed through XPS and XRD. Post-annealing at 800 ○C caused a phase change of the film to poly-crystalline perovskite and brought the composition ratio of Sr:Ti close to unity, except for the region near the surface. This implies that the film was transformed, overall, into an STO crystal. These changes were confirmed by XRD and TEM. The resistive switching characteristics of the ALD STO films were evaluated using I–V sweeping. Unipolar high resistance ratio (HRS/LRS) of about 10 –10 . The set/reset voltages and currents remained strictly separated in all the tested cycles. The charge conduction and switching mechanism are discussed. In the LRS, the injected carriers conducted via ohmic conduction behavior. For three voltage regimes (low, medium, and high) in the HRS, the conduction behavior can be explained by quasi-ohmic conduction, SCLC, and a trap-filled process, respectively. A resistive switching mechanism of trapping/detrapping of electrons at oxygen vacancies is proposed.",2,
629,"We introduce an efficient method to analyze and compare the relative retention reliability of the RRAM devices. The method is based on the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm using the Gibbs free energy as a leading indicator. We further demonstrate this approach on two MIM structures, an SL Ti/ ZrO2/Pt and a DL Ti/ZnO/ZrO2/Pt one. The simulation results clearly show that the DL device has superior LRS retention robustness due to the GFE difference between the TE and RSL materials. The more thermodynamically stable ZrO2, having a lower GFE level, easily accepts O species from the TE reservoir and requires fewer simulation steps to converge into a ruptured CF. In the DL case, the higher GFE ZnO layer effectively blocks the flow of O from the TE resulting in a “slower” convergence to a ruptured state and thus yields a more stable LRS. The rupture in this case occurs mainly due to O species supplied by the generation processes in the RSL. These results are in agreement with previously published experimental data.",46,
630,"In conclusion, a light-induced resistance effect dominated by photocarriers with a remarkable resistance change rate as much as 56% is achieved in the Au films covered two-dimensional CCs. This result is a complement of CCs’ properties and adds the photoelectricity functionality to the CCs’ system. This effect can stimulate both theoretical and experimental efforts in these two-dimensional ordered metallo-dielectric microstructures, especially to exploit their potential electrical or photoelectrical applications, such as optoelectronic switches, light memory device, light-controlled resistance circuit components.",16,
631,"Pure amorphous phase was formed in the KN films grown on the TiN-Si substrate at temperatures lower than 350oC, and the KN nanocrystal began to form in the film grown at 350oC. The εr and d33 values of the KN films grown at low temperature (≤ 300oC) were small at 22 and 16 pm/V, respectively. Increased εr and d33 values of 43 and 80 pm/V, respectively, were obtained from the KN film grown at 350oC, probably due to the existence of the KN nanocrystals. The KN PNG fabricated using the KN film grown on TiN-PI substrate at 350oC exhibited a large open-circuit output voltage (~ 2.5 V) and short-circuit output current (~ 70 nA) under the stain and strain rate of 0.76 % and 0.79 % s-1, respectively. The KN film grown on the TiN–Si substrate at 350oC exhibits a typical bipolar switching curve after the forming process, and it showed good reliability characteristics. During the set process, the oxygen ions moved into the TiN electrode, and the oxygen vacancies in KN film formed the conducting filaments. The bipolar resistive switching behavior of the Pt/KN/TiN–Si ReRAM device can be explained by the formation and rupture of the oxygen vacancy filaments. Finally, the KN ReRAM device, which was operated by the KN PNG, exhibited good resistive switching behavior, with an RHRS and RLRS ratio of 10. Furthermore, the KN film shows good biocompatibility. Therefore, the KN film grown at 350oC can be used for self–powered biomedical devices.",-1,
632,"In conclusion, high-quality epitaxial BTO/SNO/LAO heterostructures were grown on LAO substrates via PLD. The Po2 value during film deposition was found to have a strong effect on the ferroelectricity of the BTO thin films. BTO films prepared at Po2  3 Pa exhibited good ferroelectric behavior, whereas ferroelectricity was absent in the BTO films deposited at Po2 ¼ 0.2 and 0.5 Pa. Excellent RS behavior with an ON/OFF ratio of 104 % was obtained in devices containing ferroelectric BTO films, while RS behavior was not observed in devices containing non-ferroelectric BTO films. These results demonstrate that RS behavior is derived from ferroelectric polarization, which modulates the height of the potential barrier and the width of the depletion region at the BTO/SNO interface.",4,
633,"In summary, GO thin films were prepared on Pt/Ti/SiO2 / Si substrates by vacuum filtration method. Reliable and reproducible resistance switching behaviors were found in the Cu/GO/Pt devices. The resistance ratio between HRS and LRS is about 20. The memory devices exhibited good retention characteristics and low switching voltages The observed switching effect might originate from the desorption/absorption process of oxygen-related groups on the GO sheets and also the diffusion of the top electrodes.",41,
634,"As mentioned above, though planar device provides a convenient model to explore the formation process of CFs, the influence of surface and interface on this process must be carefully considered due to their lower energy barrier for ion diffusion when compared to bulk region. In previous studies, the CFs have already been testified to locate at grain bounda_xFFFE_ries in oxides based vertical devices26 and on the surfaces in nanowires, nanoislands as well as planar TiO2 based ones.27–29 Furthermore, the activation energy for surface diffusion is usually slightly lower than that for interface dif_xFFFE_fusion.20 Taking these factors into consideration, the CFs in our device most likely locate on the surface of the organic layer. To provide direct evidence for this deduction and to confirm the chemical composition of the CFs as well, a cross-sectional TEM specimen was fabricated by FIB from a device in LRS (similar to the one in Fig. 3(h)). High_xFFFE_magnification TEM images near Pt electrode, at the middle, and near Ag electrode are displayed in Figs. 5(a)–5(c), respectively. According to these figures, three main conclu_xFFFE_sions can be made directly: (i) the CFs are composed of clus_xFFFE_ters with diameters ranging from several to dozens of nanometers; (ii) the CFs are indeed on the surface of the organic layer, corroborating the deduction above; and (iii) the anodic dissolution of Ag electrode is clearly recogniz_xFFFE_able, in accordance with that in Fig. 3(h). Note that the clus_xFFFE_ters near Ag electrode (Fig. 5(c)) have anomalously small diameters when compared to that in other regions. This phe_xFFFE_nomenon can be attributed to the fact that the TEM specimen is less than 100 nm in thickness, which is much smaller than the distance of hundreds of nanometers between two adja_xFFFE_cent CFs, as indicated by Fig. 3(h). Consequently, the TEM specimen may deflect slightly from CFs, leading to the abnormal morphology. For the chemical composition of CFs, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was conducted at the area close to Pt electrode. With the pur_xFFFE_pose of enhancing sensitivities, the electron beam was adjusted to be about 1 nm in diameter, which is an ideal size to provide qualitative composition of CFs. Five typical regions are selected and denoted by dots and numbers in dif_xFFFE_ferent colors in Fig. 5(a). Corresponding spectra are listed in Fig. 5(d). The SiO2 substrate and Pt protecting layer are clearly manifested by spectra 1 (red) and 5 (magenta), respectively. The spectrum 2 (green) with large intensity ra_xFFFE_tio of S/Ag relates to the PEDOT:PSS layer. On the contrary, the spectra 3 (cyan) and 4 (blue) exhibit extremely strong Ag signal, indicating that the CFs are truly composed of Ag ele_xFFFE_ment. Furthermore, the S signals in these two spectra cannot be neglected when compared to Ag signal, implying that the Ag clusters have been partially sulfurized. This reaction is inevitable due to the low standard Gibbs free energy of for_xFFFE_mation of a-Ag2S (about 40 kJ mol–1).30 Note that the abso_xFFFE_lute intensity of S signal in spectrum 2 is slightly smaller than that in spectra 3 and 4. This phenomenon is reasonable because the atomic percentage of S in PEDOT:PSS is much smaller than that in AgxS. In addition, EDX analysis was also conducted near the middle of the specimen, and similar results have been obtained as well (Fig. S5 in supplementary materials).24",18,
635,"We now turn towards the discussion on the unique for_xFFFE_mation process of CFs in this study, i.e., the CFs nucleate ini_xFFFE_tially at the middle region of the device and then extend towards two electrodes. Previous publications depict this process in vertical organic devices by referring to that in solid electrolytes based cells. That is, the CFs grow from IE to AE.14,21 In our recent work, we suggest that the CFs in vertical organic devices grow from AE to the IE by analyz_xFFFE_ing the symmetry of I–V curves in different resistance states.23 However, the CFs in the present planar organic de_xFFFE_vice are directly demonstrated to locate on the surface of the organic layer. As mentioned above, the surface usually acts as fast diffusion channel when compared to bulk region. For example, the action energy for carbon diffusion on the sur_xFFFE_face of Ni (111) plane is only 0.4 eV, while it is about 1.6 eV for bulk diffusion.31 As a result, the mobility of Ag cations is accelerated considerably by surface diffusion in planer devi_xFFFE_ces. Subsequently, Ag cations would migrate a much longer distance before reduction, different from the scenario in our previous vertical organic devices in which the lack of the surface diffusion channel and corresponding low mobility lead to the reduction of the cations in the vicinity of AE.23 Nevertheless, the accelerated Ag mobility may be still slower than that in solid electrolytes (typical fast ionic con_xFFFE_ductors), in which Ag cations can reach IE before reduction owing to extremely high mobility.15,16 Therefore, Ag cations could be reduced initially near the middle of the planar de_xFFFE_vice. With longer voltage stress time, more clusters emerge and the chains of clusters extend towards both electrodes. When the chains of clusters are strong enough, they short_xFFFE_circuit the electrodes, resulting in the switching from HRS to LRS. A series of schematics on the formation process of the CFs is presented in Fig. S6.24",18,
636,"In summary, the CFs in Ag/PEDOT:PSS/Pt planar de_xFFFE_vice are demonstrated to be the chains of partially sulfurized Ag clusters with diameters ranging from several to dozens of nanometers. The CFs in our study are verified to locate on the surface of the organic layer, which is due to the relatively lower activation energy for diffusion at the surface when compared to that in bulk and interface. Furthermore, the CFs nucleate initially at the middle region of the device and then extend towards two electrodes, which can be ascribed to the appropriate mobility of Ag cations on the surface of the or_xFFFE_ganic layer.",18,
637,"In summary, we observed unipolar-type resistance switching in an amorphous niobium oxide (NbOx) device. The physical formation of metallic nanochannels was directly probed using in situ focused ion beam SEM. The electroforming process changed the film dramatically, inducing metallic nanostructures. The proposed model for the formation of these nanochannels can be applied more broadly to other resistance switching oxides, thereby improving our understanding of switching mechanisms.",16,
638,"1 mm-thick WOx layers sandwiched between different metal electrodes were fabricated using conventional RF sputtering, and their bipolar-type RS were investigated. Different electronegativities of the thermally fabricated metal electrodes play a key role in RS, particularly, the RS mode and on/off ratio. Al/WOx/Pt shows the CCW RS mode, and Au/WOx/Pt shows the CW RS mode. Both samples show good endurance. On/off ratios were 10 for Au/WOx/Pt and 100 for Al/WOx/Pt. Applying voltage bias to the sample, oxygen ion re-alignment occurs at the vicinity of the interface between the WOx film and electrode. Because electronegativity differences of elements affect the electron density distribution, this leads to different resistance states, either high or low. Thus, one of the key parameters, which can control the RS mode and on/off ratio, is the electronegativities of constituting elements in MeIeM ReRAM devices.",1,
639,"In summary, Ag/AIST/Ag memristors with gradual resistance tuning were demonstrated. The co-existence of intrinsic memristive characteristics (SCLC) and extrinsic electrochemical metallization effect is confirmed to be responsible for the memristive behaviors. By controlling the polarity, the amplitude, the width, and the number of applied voltage pulses, the reproducible gradual resistance tuning behavior can be tuned gradually and precisely. The gradual resistance tuning characteristics can be applied in emulating functions of biological synapses. And the devices provide feasible options for future analog applications. ",8,
640,"In conclusion, the impact of ZnO layer thickness on the properties of BTO/ZnO heterostructures was investigated XRD, PL, polarization-voltage (P-V) hysteresis and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. XRD patterns revealed that heterostructures were composed of ZnO and BTO layers only. PL analysis suggested that the two additional blue emission peaks become prominent with the decrease of ZnO layer thickness and their origin was discussed based on the energy band diagram of ZnO/BTO thin film heterostructures and interface charge effects on charge carriers. The interface charge coupling between switchable polarization of BTO and non-switchable polarization of ZnO was evidenced by P-V and I-V characteristics. The enhanced resistive switching characteristics with switching ratio 106 and stable high and low resistance states in BTO/ZnO heterostructures make them attractive for memory devices.",7,
641,"In summary, a low-operation-current CBRAM with reliable multilevel resistive switching was proposed as the structure of Pt/TaOx:Ag/TaOx/Pt. The Ag-doped memory cells lead to the morphology change of conductive filaments from continuous to cluster-type. The direct evidence of cluster-type filaments was captured via TEM observation. A correlative mechanism model is subsequently established that RS operation is dominated by electrontunneling-based filaments composed of Ag clusters. Based on the mechanism, the memory device can achieve stable 5-state multilevel data storage by means of compliance currents or RESET voltages. Moreover, the device design can be also used in other similar materials systems. The low-operation-current devices are advantageous to low-consumption application of RRAM, and the tunable multi-state resistive switching can effectively elevate storage density in the memory integration.",0,
642,"In conclusion, we investigated the dynamics of individual and coupled oscillators using LTspice simulation based on an IMT model driven by Joule heating. An oscillation window diagram was analyzed with respect to VS-RL for a single oscillator, with a color-coded map of megahertz magnitude frequency information for the case of effective capacitance C = 30 pF. Then, two identical oscillators were capacitively coupled through a mutual capacitor, and their coupling dynamics were investigated. Depending on the mismatch of the load resistance δ, the evolution of different phase diagrams can be obtained. Several distinct zones of the butterfly-shaped coupling, which include linear, transitional, and uncoupled, are indicated in different VS-CC phase diagrams. When the coupled system has a small mismatch of δ ≤ 4%, the butterfly coupling dominates, which is indicated by the VS-CC phase diagrams. Furthermore, the change in the synchronous oscillation frequency is not directly related to δ but is related to the electrical RC and VS. The results from this work show that the oscillator network based on a pair of identical NbO2 devices exhibits complex nonlinear dynamics. Future systematic work is needed to explore the coupling modes and the synchronization dynamics of two dissimilar NbO2 devices.",19,
643,"In this report, we describe the investigation of the off-to-on resistive switching of gold nanogap junction. It was found that threshold voltages during the switching were depended on electric field, the critical value of which was estimated at about 1.8 V/nm. This implies that the high-to-low resistive switching could be explained by field-induced-migration model.",43,
644,"In summary, a RRAM-based synaptic neuromorphic network is proposed to learn and recognize spatiotemporal patterns, including spike sequences and spike groups (for example, pairs) where the spike timing carries information. The time difference of spikes among different neurons provides spatiotemporal coding with high sparsity and high information capacity. Our experiments demonstrate that the RRAM-based SNN, combined with suitable neuron circuit and operation scheme, is capable of learning spatiotemporal patterns via STDP, followed by recognition, thanks to suitably potentiated/depressed synapses.

645,"In conclusion, we investigated the effect of the interfacial layer on the switching characteristics of a C-Te based binary OTS device. By introducing a thin a-Ge layer between the two electrodes and the OTS film, we confirm considerable device performance improvements such as a nearly 2 order of off-current reduction and tight distribution of Vth and Ioff, resulting in uniform switching characteristics. The formation of a small virtual electrode at the Ge layer during the first forming process, as confirmed by the area dependent measurement and simulations, is the main reason for the observed improvement. As the device area becomes relatively small, isolation of the electric field on the local region is possible and this leads to the suppression of other leakage paths and uniform switching",9,
646,"In this Tutorial, we introduced the fundamental fabrication methods for nanoscale memristive devices and arrays. Nanoimprint lithography seems to be a good lithographic candidate for this task owing to its ultimate resolution, low cost, and high throughput. Technical solutions such as versatile feature size shrinking, alignment with sub-20 nm overlay, and effective mold cleaning methods are critical for NIL during memristive array fabrication. NIL can be especially convenient for academic research groups to build large-scale prototypical arrays and systems with nanometer feature size. More comprehensive studies on the switching behavior at this ultra-small scale will be important to further improve the device performance (e.g., uniformity and yield) for largescale array operation. Meanwhile, 3D integrated system is a feasible solution for neuromorphic computing hardware. NIL also proves to be an efficient tool for 3D integration of memristor crossbars with different substrates including functional CMOS chips. Research in development of suitable array architecture, process conditions, and device engineering in 3D systems are still at the beginning stage. Mastering the fabrication and integration processes will provide us with large scale hybrid integrated memristive systems and neural networks that will find broad applications in particular future high performance computing.",76,
647,"The ZnO as a buffer layer promoted the growth of 110 film texture for the BiFeO3 thin film deposited on the Pt/TiO2 /SiO2 /Si100 substrate by off-axis rf magnetron sputtering. The BiFeO3 /ZnO thin film exhibits a much lowered dielectric loss tan 0.012 than that of the film without a ZnO buffer layer. Due to the much reduced leakage current, the bilayered thin film demonstrates a well established P-E hysteresis loop, characterized by 2Pr 153.6 C/cm2 and 2Ec 857.2 kV/cm. The fatigue endurance of the BFO/ZnO thin film is strongly dependent on measurement frequencies. A diode-like behavior and resistive hysteresis are observed for the BFO/ZnO thin film, where the rectifying ratio increases with the increase in applied voltages. The voltage at which the hysteresis occurs on the positive voltage side decreases with increasing voltage and temperature. The resistive switching behavior of the belayed BFO/ZnO thin film is shown to closely associate with the trap-controlled space charge limited current and interface-limited FN tunneling. ZnO had significantly changed the dielectric relaxation and electrical condition, where the dielectric relaxation and electrical conduction are governed by the thermal excitation of carriers from the second-ionization and short-range motion of oxygen vacancies.",4,
648,"For the realization of ultrahigh-density ferroelectric data storage devices and the clear understanding of the ferroelectric size effect, much effort has been made to develop a robust approach to fabricate structurally well-defined arrays of nanostructured ferroelectrics. For the last decade, considerable advances in the fabrication and characterization of ferroelectric nanostructures have been achieved to an extent that extensive investigations on the structure–property relationships became possible. This Review briefly summarizes the research, including the merits and demerits, of the conventional fabrication methods for ferroelectric nanostructures. The discussion further focuses on newly developed stencil-based growth of ferroelectric nanocapacitors, which allows one not only to obtain 2D-ordered arrays of single crystalline nanostructured ferroelectrics but also to investigate structure– property relationships, i.e., strain-induced domain evolution, its implications on the electric properties, a new phenomenological model for domain dynamics, and cross-talk. These results should be applicable to a wide range of functional oxides in addition to ferroelectrics, e.g., to study domain dynamics in nanoscale multiferroics or potential applications of nanosized oxide capacitors for resistive memory (ReRAM) devices.

High-performance resistive switching memory characteristics with excellent uniformity of HRS/LRS and SET/RESET, excellent read endurance of >1 × 10^5 cycles, multilevel operation, and stable resistance ratios of 10^5 for bipolar operation and 10^9 for unipolar operation that maintain a data retention time of more than 1 × 10^4 s under low-voltage operation of <1.5 V are obtained. The memory device can be operated at a current as low as 1 nA. This resistive memory device can be useful in future low-power nanoscale high-density nonvolatile memory applications.",0,
650,"In conclusion, electrical measurement and material analysis are carried out in this experiment to present a model for a CBRAM device developed by co-sputtering the Cu and SiO2 targets, whose operation is controlled depending on the set voltage and compliance current. A positive set condition produces operation from the TiN electrode, while a negative set condition does so with the Pt electrode. An intermediate condition, however, can be produced by controlling the voltage and compliance current such that CRS under doubleelectrode operation results. As long as the amount of Cu in the device is limited, the device can be controlled and operated by CRS, providing a more cost-effective process.",11,
651,"In conclusion, we demonstrated polarity dependent resistance switching in crystallized Sb-excess Ge2Sb2+xTe5 ﬁlms from macro- to nanoscales. Voltage pulses showed this switching within time scales of microseconds with more than 40% contrast between the resistance states for macroscopic contacts. Moreover, using conductive atomic force microscopy, switching was also possible at nanoscales with a better resistance contrast of more than three orders of magnitude. Notably, the switching _x0001_write/erase_x0002_ voltage of ±1.1 V is fairly small compared to those used in current ferroelectric and ﬂash memories, and is compatible with future microelectronic and data storage systems. Our study shows conclusively that in a single material phase-change and polaritydependent switching can be combined.",54,
652,"The rate limiting process in the forming of a Cu/Ta2O5/Pt gapless-type atomic switch is the drift of Cu cations, which is determined by measuring the dependence of the forming time on temperature and the thickness of the Ta2O5 layer. The activation barrier for Cu drift is estimated to be 0.4 eV, which is 0.2 eV lower than the previously reported value for the annealed Ta2O3 layer. The difference of about 0.2 eV is explained by the existence of water molecules in the amorphous Ta 05 matrix. The Ta2O5 matrix in this study was not annealed, and the remaining water molecules lower the diffusion barrier.",56,
653,"In summary, a facile approach to fabricate pure and Co doped CeO2 nanorods based RS devices was presented. It is demonstrated that binary memristive devices based on Co-doped CeO2 exhibit native stochastic nature of resistive switching. Even for a fixed voltage on the same device, the wait time is not fixed but with random and broad distribution. However, the probability of switching can be predicted and controlled by the applied voltage and the pulse width used to program the device. The present study demonstrated that 1-D oriented nano-architectures can potentially be applied for future stochastic and neuromorphic applications.",8,
654,"In summary, epitaxial and self-assembled BFO nanocapacitor cell structures with lateral size of 10-30 nm have been fabricated using a one-step PLD process. Each cell consists of a conductive bismuth rich nano-island as top electrode, an ultrathin BFO layer of 3.0 nm in thickness as dielectric layer, and a LSMO layer as bottom electrodes. It has been revealed that the nano-capacitor structures not only prefer to accommodate ferroelectric anti-domains in contrast to the uniform polarization state of the bare BFO area but also apparently lower the polarization switching field. The nano-capacitors also exhibit attractive resistive switching behaviors, promising for non-destructive read-out highdensity (e.g., Tbit/in.2 ) non-volatile memories.",40,
655,"In summary, 40 nm, 70 nm, and 150 nm (001)-oriented phase pure epitaxial BFO thin films have been realized on LSMO buffered (001) STO substrates through CSD processing. Even though we used a stoichiometric precur-sor, accurate control of the Bi/Fe ratio was achieved through optimization of the annealing conditions thereby obtaining phase pure BFO thin films. Robust ferroelectric properties with square hysteresis loops, low leakage cur-rent, and high-cycle polarization fatigue resistance for the as-prepared BFO thin films were obtained at room tem-perature. The best properties were found for the 150 nm thick films with 2Pr = 100 μC/cm^2, peak dielectric constant of 613 and a loss tangent of ~ 0.045. In contrast, the resistive switching behaviour becomes weaker with film thickness increase, with ON/OFF ratio at 1 V reducing from 38 in 40 nm thin film to 4.5 in 150 nm thin film. It is thought the presence of oxygen vacancies contribute = to the resistive switching and switchable diode effect, which can be controlled by ferroelectric polarization direction. Having said these, the above electrical properties of our CSD derived BFO thin films shows the potential to elimi-nate the gap between CSD and physical deposition meth-ods, such as PLD and RF sputtering, thereby promoting the wide applications of BFO through industrial mass manufacture.",4,
656,"In conclusion, the a-IGZO thin ﬁlms have been fabricated by a low temperature photochemical solution deposition method combining chemical solution deposition and ultraviolet irradiation treatment. The Pt/a-IGZO/Pt cells show reprodu- cible and highly uniform RS properties in set and reset switching voltages as well as the stable distribution of LRS and HRS. The high uniformity of the RS properties can be attributed to reduction of residual content and formation of enhanced M-O bonding and M-OH bonding by hydrogen bonding as well as passivation of charge traps by hydrogen bonding. Our results also suggest that the low temperature photochemical solution deposition method can ﬁnd the opportunity for achieving system on panel applications if the RS cells were integrated with the low temperature processed a- IGZO TFT.",50,

658,"The conductivity shown in FJU-23-H2O along the c axis is inferred to be proton conduction based on the experiments and results men- tioned above: (i) The ac impedance spectroscopy shows that the Nyquist plots display a semicircle at high frequency. (ii) The temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy shows that the con- ductivity is improved with increasing temperature. (iii) The control experiments show the higher gate voltage and the lower current for FJU-23-D2O than FJU-23-H2O. (iv) The difference Fourier maps show that the bias-forced electrical bistability originates from the hydrogen atom on O1w switching between O11 and O31 atoms. Proton-conducting MOFs containing chiral proton channels with switched hydrogen bond pathway have great advantages as high-performance RRAM materials: (i) The proton carriers having smaller ionic radius and larger electromobility than other cationic or anionic carriers can reduce the set voltage to cut down energy consumption of the devices. (ii) The switched hydrogen bond pathway can impart the proton channels with voltage-gated effect and then increase the ON/OFF ratio of the devices. (iii) Asymmetric structure that originated from the chiral proton channel can endow the device with rectifying effect, as in the cases of the molecular rectifiers (43). Moreover, high-density storage is another important performance pursued by the semicon- ductor industry, and the characteristics of the long-range order of MOFs in microcosmic may provide a possibility for high-density storage. If we alternate FJU-23-H2O’s hexagonal channels as RRAM cell and its framework as shield, then an ultrahigh storage density of 17.5 TB/cm2 can be realized, which is 100 times higher than the storage density of a traditional mechanical hard disk, although the corresponding integration technology still needs to be explored. Note that those proton-conducting MOF-based RRAMs involve MOFs and solid-state ionics to realize the on-demand regulation of resistance switching performance. Compared to traditional solid- state ionics subjected to purely inorganic materials, metal-organic solid ionics shows great advantage in regulating ion transport structure and in exploring the relationship between structures and properties, establishing the unambiguous role of metal-organic solid-state ionics in conducting devices. In conclusion, we have observed a self-rectifying RRAM based on a single metal-organic material FJU-23-H2O with the switched hydrogen bond pathway. The voltage-gated proton-conducting behavior in FJU-23-H2O has been confirmed. The device exhibits an ultralow set voltage (~0.2 V), a high ON/OFF ratio (~105), and a high rectification ratio (~105), which is beneficial to reducing energy consumption, to simplifying signal amplifying circuit, and to alleviating sneak path issue in the device. By SCXRD, we demonstrate that the switching mechanism of FJU-23-H2O is attributed to the turn ON/OFF of the chiral proton channels with the switched hydrogen bond pathway under the stimulus of dc voltages, establishing the unam- biguous role of metal-organic solid-state ionics in the conducting device.",-1,
659,"In summary, we developed a laterally bridged ZnO NR-based memory device with unique and excellent memory characteristics using a simple fabrication process. A preliminary investigation and thorough discussion of isolated boundaries were performed for the first time. The equivalent thickness of the memory cell was much less than the total length of a laterally bridged ZnO NR. The formation and rupture of conductive filaments occurred at the boundaries of the NR/NR interfaces resulting from the high density of accumulated defects. The laterally bridged ZnO NR-based memory is stable, rewritable, and nonvolatile with on−off current ratio higher than 1 × 106 and long retention up to 1.56 × 106 s. This finding confirms that the laterally bridged ZnO NR-based device is a potential candidate for application in next-generation nonvolatile memory.",21,
660,"In summary, the negative differential resistance was observed in ZnO/NSTO heterojunctions at 140–300 K with bipolar resistive switching. The absolute value of the NDR peak intensity is enhanced ﬁrst and then weakened, while the NDR peak position gradually shifts toward the absolute low voltage with an increase in temperature from 140 to 300 K, and shifts toward the absolute large voltage with an increase in temperature from 300 to 400 K. The NDR peak is absent after applying a short positive pulse width of 10 ns-1 ls, while the NDR peak gradually increases with the increase in the pulse amplitude and width. These behaviors can be fully understood from the genera- tion and drift of ionized oxygen vacancies coupled with the trapping/ detrapping electrons.",7,
661,"In conclusion, SiOx RRAM devices with an MIM structure were fabricated and achieved negligible external series resistance. Compared with an MIS device structure, MIM structures showed very different reset behavior. This phenomenon can be explained by a positive feedback mechanism that is only observed when there is a large voltage drop across an external resistance. By measuring MIM RRAM devices in series with a standalone resistor, we verified our hypothesis and further explained the external resistance effect using a load line approach. By comparing cycle endurance data of MIM devices with and without an external resistor, we demonstrated that proper design of external resistance can improve LRS programing stability during the set operation. Finally, we provided additional insights into optimizing external resistance to achieve the desired balance between program stability and operating speed.",6,
662,"It is shown in this paper that bromine intercalation of thin (-1 pm diameter) and thick (~10 μm diameter) vapor- grown graphite fibers obtained by benzene decomposition yields fibers with high electrical conductivity and a high degree of air and thermal stability. Bromine intercalation was carried out by direct immersion of the fibers into liquid bromine at room temperature, as a simple way to form highly conductive compounds. The thick brominated fibers exhibit six to seven times lower electrical resistivities than their corresponding pristine fibers, with magnitudes of p as low as 10 pH cm under ambient conditions. Thin fibers show a resistivity decrease by a factor of ~ 5 upon bromination, measured as a compressed fiber mass. The brominated thin fibers are found to be much more highly conductive than conductive grade commercial carbon blacks, which could be classified as a highly conductive particlelike carbon. The brominated fibers used in this study were intercalated to approximately stage 5 for the thick fibers, while the thin fibers showed poor staging fidelity. Despite the poor staging characteristics, the brominated fibers showed large increases in conductivity and good stability under ambient conditions (less than 3% decrease in conductivity after exposure to air for 1 month). Both the thin. and thick brominated fibers showed a high degree of thermal stability with almost no change in electrical resistivity for temperatures up to 200 ·C, though some weight loss by deintercalation was observed. On the basis of these observations it is concluded that the brominated graphite fibers based on vapor-grown carbon fiber precursors could be suitable for applications as lightweight highly conducting filler materials in carbon fiber reinforced plastics. Work on such composite materials is now in progress, emphasizing plastic host materials that are chemically compatible with the brominated fibers under investigation and will be reported elsewhere.",32,
663,"We have carried out experimental investigations confirming that thin films of copper oxide with a bulk rich in Cu2O and a surface consisting of a Cu2O/CuO mixture can be prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering in a controlled and consistent manner. We have identified the deposition parameters and processing windows for achieving phase partitioning in the films. The partitioning is confirmed by XRD, FTIR, and optical band gap measurements, which indicate that the bulk of the film is predominantly made up of the Cu2O phase. XPS analysis reveals that the surface of the films consists of a mixture of the Cu2O/CuO phases. This partitioning was explained in terms of ion flux ratio’s and sticking probabilities between oxygen and copper during deposition. The partitioning has been identified as a necessary condition for observing reversible resistive memory switching in copper oxide films prepared by other methods. The deposited films followed a Volmer-Weber growth mode with a potential for facilitating oxygen vacancy migration and conducting filaments at the columnar interfaces. The details of the resistive switching properties of our films will be the subject of a future publication.",62,

The achievement of memorization with a wide range of time scales enabled the “forgetting process” observed in biological information processing to be imi- tated. Even though the nonvolatile memorization needs an irreversible forming process, the as-prepared nanode- vice was controllably preprogrammed to perform a large variety of functions at will and is shown to be used as a variable resistance element, a diode, a switch, or a neuro- morphic memory. These capabilities open a new avenue for circuits, analog memories, and artiﬁcially fused digitalneural networks using programming by input pulse polarity, magnitude, and repetition history.",74,

The solution-processed HfAlOx thin film was deposited by the spin-coating method and it has a uniform set/reset voltage distribution. Moreover, the fabricated device achieved good endurance characteristics that clearly separate the on and off states without failure and showed outstanding retention haracteristics at RT and a high temperature. Therefore, the solution-processed HfAlOx-thin-film-based ReRAM is expected to be used in see-through system-on-chip (SoC) applications as well as a fully transparent nonvolatile memory of the stand-alone type.",5,
666,"In summary, acceptor doping is an effective method to improve the RS properties of the SnO2 device by modulating the concentration of carriers and VOs. When the content of Cu doping is 15%, the optimal Cu/SCO/Pt RS performance including the high ON/OFF ratio (104 ), good endurance (104 ), and long retention (104 s) is achieved. Additionally, the multi-resistance switching behavior is benefited from the cooperation of CFs and Schottky barrier, and during the switching process, the VOs not only constitutes the CFs but also indirectly modulates the Schottky barrier. As a memristor, the digital and analog behaviors triggered by a train of constant pulses can be used to simulate the LTP of biological synapses and the wispy weighting changes of perceptron, respectively. These advantages confirm that the SCO-based RS is a promising candidate for the next generation memory and neuromorphic computing systems.",-1,
667,"To summarize, a highly stretchable (680% strain) liquid metal polymer with the capability of a temperature-controlled reversible electrical transition between insulator and conductor was demonstrated. The liquid metal droplets are enclosed with the insulative silicone shell and it is nonconductive. Under low temperature condition (T = 212 K), the liquid metal droplets solidify and expand in volume, whereas the insulating polymer shrinks and becomes rigid, leading to the connection of liquid metal (conductive). It would recover to the initial state when heating. Furthermore, a simplified model has been built up to quantitatively predict the expansion and connection of liquid metal droplets. The electrical transition cycles between insulator and conductors have been demonstrated for more than 100 times without structural damage. Importantly, only with the proper fabrication methods, such as appropriate liquid metal loading content, stirring time, curing time, TIC can achieve insulator–metal transition by freezing or heating, which is fully clarified in this study. TIC has the ability to easily (just freezing and heating), rapidly (3 sec), dramatically (10^9 times) and reversibly (100 times without degradation) change resistivity as necessary, which presents tremendous application potential in wide areas. Lower electrical transition temperature (about 212 K) limits some applications on earth. However, Antarctica and outer space planets such as Mars may provide a superexcellent application environment for such material. Lastly, this study reveals a universal strategy to achieve the reversible insulator–metal transition materials, whose working mechanism would help incubate diverse and unconventional liquid hybrid materials.",52,
668,"We have exploited the problem of ion migration in perovskite materials by developing a gated perovskite memristor (memtransistor). The memtransistor shows excellent state retention abilities and good resistive switching endurance. The additional terminal (the gate) enables continuous state tuning and allows state programming to be executed simultaneously with reading. This is essential for neuromorphic architectures, where synaptic neuron activities often exhibit dependencies on a third modulatory terminal that cannot be fully addressed by 2T memristors.",8,
669,"The proposed memtransistor thus provides an opportunity to turn the ion migration drawback of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites into a useful attribute. Furthermore, the hybrid perovskites are appealing for affordable, large-area and/or flexible memristor applications, given that they can be synthesized at low costs from simple precursors through solution processing or vapor deposition methods.",12,
670,"We demonstrate a compatible and robust composite with LIG integrated into a variety of materials. Many of the LIGC composites have enhanced hydrophobicity due to specific surface roughness. This roughness is engineered by tuning the laser to optimize the surface characteristics that lead to superhydrophobicity. With high electrical conductivity, LIGCs have potential for use in soft electronics, including wearable thermal therapy and RRAM devices, and in deicing, anti-icing, antibiofouling and antimicrobial applications. This approach offers a series of multifunctional composites that integrate the properties of LIG, producing robust nanomaterials that have applications in multiple fields.",36,
671,"In the present study, we proposed an essential mechanism of polarization-induced resistance switching effects considering the boundary injection of charges through the asymmetric effective potential. We conclude that the low-resistance state ( ON state ) appears when the polarization is directed toward the metal electrode whose work function is smaller. Furthermore, in order to explain the large ON=OFF ratio obtained in experiments, the surface dead layer on the smaller work function side should be thicker than the opposite layer. We may reproduce experimentally the present results by introducing an artificial dead layer at metal=ferroelectric boundaries, such as the nonpolar dielectric SrTiO3, although the origin of the dead layer is not clarified. On the basis of the above results, we have shown a simple “boundary injection mechanism”, in order to explain the polarization-induced resistance switching effects of films thicker than 10 nm. The present concept may be useful when the thickness of ferroelectric films is over 10 nm and charge injection is conducted through the film. Here, the resistance of the injected current is assumed to be negligible.",4,
672,"Finally, we note that the present analysis does not include the effects of thermal fluctuations. It is well known3, 30,31 ) that the temperature dependence of current appears in some inorganic ferroelectric tunneling junctions. However, the temperature dependence of the electric currents has not been reported in the case of VDF=TrFE. Then, at the present stage, we discuss it only in terms of quantum mechanics as a first step toward understanding the polarization-induced resistance switching effects of polymer thin films. Further studies will clarify how the resistance switching effect depends on the thermal fluctuations. The inclusion of finite-temperature effects and the consideration of the material structure of films will be of great interest from the viewpoint of constructing switching devices.",17,
673,"In summary, the ground state energy of the 1D F-AF model (1) in the vicinity of the transition point 𝛼 = 1/4 is considered. Using the linear spin-wave approximation and the Green’s function approach in a very regular way, we obtain an integral expression (16) for the ground state energy including the quantum correction. The critical behavior of the ground state energy is described by the function 𝜖(√8𝛾, 𝛾 + 1/4) in Eq. (17) and the result is 𝐸(𝛾)/𝑁 = −8𝛾^2, which is compared with the previous results in Fig. 1. Overall, our results are close to previous results, which meas that our treatment is effective. Furthermore, our treatment is easier and more straightforward. If we go one step further to consider the interacting term of spin waves, a more reliable result will probably be obtained.",-1,
674,"It is known that the total energy of the 𝑀-magnon state of the model (1) is 𝐸_𝑀 = −8𝑀𝛾^2. [21,30] The critical behavior of the ground state energy 𝐸/𝑁 = −8𝛾^2 means that 𝑁 noninteracting magnons are created in the ground state.",-1,
675,"Multistep resistance switching, in which each step occurs within 100 ns, was observed in a planar VO2/c-Al2O3 device with dimensions of 5/1500 mm (electrode gap/electrode length). It was shown that the appearance of the multistep phenomenon is related to the combination of device temperature and frequency of applied pulse voltage. Rapid resistance change was clearly observed even at an elevated temperature of 323 K under a low pulse frequency. Diﬀerent runs at diﬀerent pulse duty values at a frequency of 100 kHz resulted in the appearance of the same static resistance state. XRD measurements for an in situ heated VO2 ﬁlm showed that structural lattice transformation occurs at a temperature lower than that at which a rapid decrease in resistance starts. From these results and optical microscope observations of ﬁlamentary current paths in VO2 layers, we speculate that inhomogeneity of the crystalline lattice of the VO2 ﬁlms enables easy formation of a current path in a certain spot. Alternating between widening the current path and increasing the current density causes multistep changes in I–V characteristics.",29,
676,"We investigated the unipolar resistance switching in Pt/Ta2O5 x/Pt, Ni/Ta2O5 x/Pt, and Ti/Ta2O5 x/Pt cells. We observed that unipolar resistance switching could occur independently of the electrodes. We found that the required voltages for the forming process did not depend on the top electrode type but on the film thickness of Ta2O5 x. Further investigations are expected to reveal the switching mechanism of URS and improve the device performance for Ta2O5 x thin films.",56,
677,"In this study, the characteristics of a bidirectional cell selector device with highly nonlinear I-V curve have been clarified by introducing a multilayer oxide via the engineering of the tunnel barrier. To clarify the device characteristics, various factors such as the dependence of materials and process conditions were thoroughly investigated. The insulting oxide layer at both interfaces should clearly satisfy requirements such as thickness and film conditions to reduce the leakage current. These results strongly suggest that the optimum combination of several properties is necessary to maximize the selector performance for high-density cross-point RRAM applications.",6,
678,"In conclusions, via-hole-type DLC based RRAM devices have been fabricated and investigated. A reliable and reversible RS behavior is observed without any high voltage forming process. The device can be only programmed with pulses wider than 50 ns for SET operations when the pulse voltage is 1.2 V and erased with pulses narrower than 25 ns for RESET operations when the pulse voltage is 0.4 V. Moreover, smaller ICC results in lower power consumption and slower SET speed, demonstrating the trade-off between power consumption and speed. The formation, rupture, and re-growth of the conductive sp2 -like graphitic filaments is proposed to be responsible for the resistive switching, based on which the effects of pulse widths on the programming and erasing characteristics of the RRAM devices can be well explained.",30,
679,"In summary, reproducible resistance switching in Pt/TiO2/Nb:STO/Pt devices has been investigated for nonvolatile memory device application. Initially, the devices showed extremely weak resistance hysteresis in positive region. However, after applying sufficient reverse bias, the hysteresis became pronounced. The origin of the reversebias-induced switching behavior would be attributed to the modification of Schottky-like barrier width modulated by oxygen vacancies accumulating (extracting) into (from) the TiO2/Nb:STO interface.",-1,
680,"In conclusion, we demonstrate that redox processes are responsible for the resistive switching in VCM cells but not (or not only) a shift of charged species, e.g., oxygen vacancies. We found that moisture is playing a signifi cant role in the process. The infl uence of a graphene monolayer and thin carbon fi lm as an intermediate layer between Ta and Ta 2 O 5 is related to the inhibition of the TaO x formation and the oxygen evolution reactions. The interlayers suppress oxygen redox reactions signifi cantly and change the switching dynamics from wellknown VCM type to ECM-like operation mode. Hence, we suggest VCM and ECM are electrochemically linked, and the characteristics of the ReRAM cells are tunable by proper interface engineering.",32,
681,"In conclusion in Au/Fe2O3/Pt heterostructure, a sharp transition between two stable resistance sates was observed. The R-T properties and the magnetization of the two resistance states showed a large discrepancy. The electric and magnetic manipulation is believed to result from a redox transition between the original Fe3þ-abundant Fe2O3 phase and a Fe2þ-abundant phase, which is caused by Vo migration. The increase of conductivity and magnetization can be explained through the electron hopping and spin exchange coupling mechanism. Both the controlling of x in FeOx by fabrication atmosphere and the modulation of transport and magnetic properties in Au/a-Fe2O3/Pt heterostructure suggested the crucial role of oxygen vacancy in this system.",64,
682,"In summary, MoSe2 doped ultralong Se microwires with a length / diameter ratio of ~240 have been developed using hydrothermal synthesis. An ERSM behaviour with a stable resistance ratio of ~10^2 for 5000 s, stable performance during 500 retention testing cycles, and strong immunity to the voltage scan rate has been experimentally observed in a single MoSe2 - doped ultralong Se microwire based memory device. After carefully considering the dynamic process of the traps filling, de-trapping, and free-charge migration, we confirmed that the trap - controlled SCLC dominates the observed ERSM behaviours. The work provides a revelation on the development of next - generation, high - performance, low - cost memory device based on the trap controlled SCLC governed micrometer - scale devices.",66,
683,"In conclusion, multimodal scanning probe microscopy techniques were applied via ﬁrst-order reversal curve I−V measurements in conjunction with electrochemical strain microscopy in epitaxial NiO nanocrystal grown onto a SRO bottom electrode. This hysteretic I−V behavior shows resetting of conductivity between applied pulses. Further inspection through the application of FORC-IV pulses and mathematical treatment of these I−V curves shows that the modulation of barrier height due to oxygen vacancy concentration changes is responsible to drive the switching mechanism. Further analysis of the electrochemical strain mapping and frequency dispersion as well as their cross-correlation behavior demonstrates strong cross-coupling between the elastic properties and vacancy diﬀusion within the NiO nanocrystals. These experiments show the use of multimodal imaging in directly probing mechanical and electrical loss within resistive switching devices at the nanoscale and can be applied to a wide variety of systems including memristive materials and phase-change memories.",54,
684,"In conclusion, four bulk-limited models were applied to the simulation of the experimental charge transport of the SiNx-based memristor in various states. The Frenkel model of isolated Coulombic trap ionization predicts too small trap concentration values for SiNx. In addition, the Frenkel model gives the fitting parameter of the high frequency dielectric permittivity in HRS and LRS, which is too big for an SiNx structure. The Hill-Adachi model of overlapping Coulombic centers quantitatively explains the slope in the charge transport of the SiNx-based RRAM in the HRS but predicts the small attempt to escape factor in all states. The ME-L multiphonon model predicts a low trap concentration value in the VS and a high trap concentration values in the HRS and LRS. Therefore, the ME-L model gives the trap concentration value beyond the model applicability range. The N-G model of phonon-assisted electron tunneling between nearby traps described the charge transport in the SiNx-based memristor with a reasonable trap concentration and trap energies. However, the N-G model gives small effective electron mass values in the HRS and LRS, which can be clarified when solving the Poisson equation with the Shockley-ReadHall statistics for trap occupation.",26,
685,"In summary, the multilevel ON- states as well as the multilevel OFF- states are demonstrated for data storage in the Ti/CuxO/Pt device. The effects of the current compliance and the span of voltage sweeping on the multilevel RS properties are also investigated into the RS mechanism of this device. Due to the formation of the interface layer between the Ti and CuxO films, the carrier conduction mechanism in the Ti/CuxO/Pt device behaves according to SCLC theory, and the RS is dependent on the bias polarity. The interface layer is proposed to be employed as the series resistance and the oxygen reservoir, which provides oxygen ions for inducing the redox reaction of the conducting filaments near the Ti/ CuxO interface. Accordingly, by varying the operated parameters, controlling the interfacial oxygen ion migration is suggested to influence the degree of filaments formation/ rupture, leading to the multilevel RS phenomena in the Ti/CuxO/Pt device. As for the MLC application, the EPIR property test is performed as well. It reveals that at least five- level resistance states can be successfully demonstrated in this memory device. Based on the experimental results, all the multilevel memory states are distinguishable and exhibit nondestructive readout property. It indicates that the Ti/CuxO/Pt device has the promising potential for nonvolatile multilevel memory applications.",34,

688,"In summary, a core-shell nanowire/nanotube array with a density of as high as 10^8~10^9 cm^-2 was fabricated by using a template-assisted technique. Even higher density (e.g. 10^12 cm^-2) can be achieved by using lower interspacing (10 nm), although the deposition of multilayers in such small nanopores is challenging. We demonstrated that both the electrodes (TiN and Pt) and semiconductor (TiO2) could be fabricated by using conformal ALD technique. The potential application of this core-shell nanostructure array for RRAM was presented. Such 3D vertical RRAM array can provide high device density with the same density of the nanostructures which only needs one-time lithography for patterning the nanopores and hence is superior to 2D architectures (multi-time lithography) and traditional lithography (unfavorable for mass production). Because of the high crystallinity of the materials, the large contact area and the intimate interface (3 nm) between the TiN and TiO2, ultralow voltage operation (mV magnitude) and ultralow power consumption (pW magnitude) were achieved. It should be noted that many kinds of materials can be fabricated by using the similar procedure with ours. The materials used here are to demonstrate the template-assisted technique for creating a non-volatile memory technology as proof of concept. This cost-effective method to fabricate such kind of 3D electronic device arrays with CMOS-compatibility and the capability to adjust the device densities can be extended to other applications of the next generation nanodevice technology.",9,

Fundamental ReRAM properties and the scalability down to 30-nm width were confirmed. Furthermore, the switching energy decrease with a smaller W was confirmed. The mechanism of the ReRAM effect is considered to be the bonding state change in the disordered carbon area caused by the electrical forming process. These results may open a way to the realization of system-on-a-chip (SoC) LSI involving only graphene devices.",32,

691,"In conclusion, we propose a dielectric breakdown model for ferroelectric o-HfO2 capacitors, where the separation of metal Hf filaments accounts for the breakdown. Charge injection caused by the transient unscreened bound charges during ferroelectric polarization switching plays a key role in this mechanism. On the other hand, the relative band alignment between the ferroelectric and the metal determines the charge state of the generated oxygen vacancies, where neutral vacancies tend to yield metallic Hf phases. We attribute the experimentally observed strong tendency of dielectric breakdown in the TaN/o-HfO2/TaN ferroelectric capacitor, compared with TiN/o-HfO2/TiN, to its lower Schottky barrier. Due to the spontaneous polarization and surface bound charges, the Schottky barrier between o-hafnia and TaN can be at maximum 1.2 eV lower than that with TiN, when the polarization direction is perpendicular to the junction area. Ab initio calculations confirm that in TaN/oHfO2/TaN, the surface oxygen vacancies tend to be neutral, which can accumulate to yield phase separation. For TiN/oHfO2/TiN, however, the surface oxygen vacancies tend to be positively charged, which avoid each other due to Coulomb repulsion. Hence, with TiN electrodes, the oxygen vacancies are distributed more uniformly, resisting the formation of a metallic filament. However, fatigue is commonly reported in TiN/o-HfO2/TiN ferroelectric capacitors, which can be attributed to the charged oxygen vacancies that may pin the domain walls.",1,
692,"In this letter, we propose a memristor integrated with MXene and reveal the manipulation of the compliance current in electroforming process on the short-term plasticity and long-term plasticity of the memristor. By controlling the compliance current during electroforming process, memristors may present different responses to the same stimulation, such as bidirectional DC voltage sweeping and paired pulse. In addition, we also find that the memristors electroformed with large compliance current possess more obvious long-term synaptic plasticity such as LTP/LTD. This work would be meaningful for manipulating the behavior of memristor and obtaining stable electronic synapses; thus, providing effective guidance in promoting the application of memristor in brain-inspired computing systems.",3,
693,"Finally, we note that the Ta-O bonding is ionic. This means that the “bonds” shown in Figs. 3, 5, and 6 are not like 2-electron covalent bonds, they do not have a constant bond strength. When a Ta-O bond is broken, it does not
give rise to a “dangling bond” in the true sense. If a bond is
broken, then the strengths of the remaining bonds around
that Ta increase to maintain a more constant total bond
strength.",35,
694,"In conclusion, we have studied the behavior of O vacancies in the k phase model of Ta2O5. This new phase has an adaptive lattice. The formation of intra-layer O vacancies causes long-range rearrangements of the bonding in the layer. The 2-fold intra-layer vacancy is the lowest cost vacancy with a formation energy of 4.28 eV in the O-rich limit, and it gives a defect state 1.5 eV below the conduction band edge. The atomic rearrangements are consistent with low defect migration energies. The inter-layer vacancy is the highest cost vacancy and has a simple structure.",35,
695,"In summary, we have successfully demonstrated an effect analogous to STM-to-LTM transition in a nanoscale memristor device. The pronounced similarity between ion diffusion and memory decay is explained by the stretched-exponential relaxation that reasonably correlates physical mechanisms to both phenomena. We showed that the memristor device retention can be improved with the application of repeated stimulations in a fashion similar to the STM-to-LTM transition in biological systems. In addition, we verified that not only the shape or the total number of stimuli is influential, but also the interval between repetitions also plays an important role in determining the effectiveness of the STM-to-LTM transition. Considering memory is an essential building block in learning and decision-making, the demonstration of such functionalities in a nanoscale memristor synapse is crucial for the realization of neuromorphic systems and artificial neural networks.",3,
696,"More strictly, memory consolidation in biological systems is a complex process comprising synaptic consolidation, system consolidation, and reconsolidation.39 Themost important physiologicalmechanism underlying synaptic consolidation is long-term potentiation (LTP) by which strong and long-lasting synaptic connections are formed.40 Whereas synaptic consolidation takes place from minutes to hours after a learning or stimulation event, system consolidation occurs days to weeks after the event, and during this period of time brain circuits are reorganized so that memories become stable within the system. However, memories become labile and unstable after recalls, and reconsolidation is necessary to stabilize, modify, and strengthen LTM. Oftentimes, the formation of STM (rehearsal) and LTM (consolidation) involves not only molecular and cellular reactions, but also cognitive and psychological behaviors.41,42 Whether in neurobiology or in psychology, details of these processes are still under debate. Hence, we would like to emphasize that our objective of this study is to demonstrate phenomena observed in a memristor synapse that exhibit similar effects to the STM-to-LTM transition in biological systems, instead of trying to form strict oneto- one correlation with biological systems at the molecular or cellular level.",74,
697,"A multi-color light-modulated transparent memristor composed of BP@PS NSs and ITO electrodes is designed, fabricated, and demonstrated. The virtues of the ITO/BP@PS/ITO device include no initial pre-forming, small operation voltage of ~0.5 V, and high ON/OFF ratio of ~10^2 , as well as long retention time of ~10^4 s at an operating temperature of 85℃. Current conduction from LRS to HRS is explained by the ohmic contact to Schottky contact mechanism. The properties of the memristor is improved by light illumination ranging between UV (380 nm) and NIR (785 nm). Both the resetting voltage and power consumption are reduced and the ON/OFF ratio increases by 10 times. The RS improvement stems from capture of photo-generated electrons by trapping sites consequently increasing the Schottky barrier height. The BP-based transparent memristor has excellent properties and light-modulation introduces a new strategy to improve the performance of devices under concerted electrical and optical stimulations.",76,
698,"In conclusion, we have fabricated MoS2/graphene memristors using large area CVD-grown MoS2 and graphene. These memristive devices are nonvolatile and exhibit multiple conductance levels, which cause them to behave as synapses. Also, these devices exhibit a near linear weight update with identical input pulses, and obey the asym-metric Hebbian learning rule, which is advantageous for their applica- tions in unsupervised learning. The devices exhibit excellent room temperature data retention for 􏰀104 s. Additionally, the devices exhibit STP, and undergo LTP and LTD for >10 s. These MoS2/gra- phene memristive devices show the necessary characteristics of a bio- logical synapse, making them perfect for implementation in neuromorphic hardware for machine learning applications.",3,
699,"In summary, we have presented a quantum dot floating gate transistor featuring a memristive operation mode. Sweeping closed voltage cycles allows to charge and discharge QDs in close vicinity of a 2DEG, resulting in a pinched hysteresis loop with two clearly distinguishable conductive states around zero bias. The memristive operation mode is observed up to temperatures of 165 K. The conductance of the device can be controlled by the charging voltage or the time difference between rectangular voltage pulses applied directly to the source and drain contact. The presented QD floating gate transistor with its memristive operation mode may be considered to realize artificial synapses in future non-von Neumann computer architectures.",3,
700,"In summary, the memristive performances of TaOx films with graded oxygen content were examined in detail. These devices demonstrated lower forming voltages, more uniform operating voltages, and up to 10.9 kX LRS and 467 kX HRS that help to suppress the leakage current. The cycling endur- ance of over 104 times was confirmed by the 100 ns, 50 ns, and 10 ns pulse widths with lower operating voltages than previous reports. Data retention of HRS and LRS at 85 ○C lasts for 104 s. These high performances can be attributed to the graded oxygen content, resulting in the electric-field gra- dient and temperature gradient along the conduction path, limiting the formation or rupture of the random CFs to the customized highest oxygen concentration zone. Hence, using TaOx films with oxygen concentration gradient is an effec- tive way towards high-performance memory device.",45,
701,"In conclusion, the BRS mechanism is demonstrated for annealed GO thin film based two terminal device structures in M2(Au,Al)/GO(T)/M1(ITO,Au,Al) configurations. Applying voltage in a complete sweep cycle of 0 → +Vmax → 0 → -Vmax → 0, through M2/GO(T)/M1 structures with Al as one of the electrodes (M1 or M2 = Al), a decrease in the electronic current with an abrupt LRS → HRS transition is observed at V+th and the device regains the original LRS at V-th. A maximum BRS with switching ratio of ~10^4 order between two distinguished resistive states (HRS and LRS) is achieved in annealed GO thin film based Al/GO(200°C)/ITO device structures. This BRS in repeated voltage sweep is initiated with the Al filament breaking at V+th due to the combined effect of Joule heating in the filaments and Peltier heat generation at the GO/ITO interface, followed by the formation of Al-filaments due to electric field induced metal ion movements through GO film prompting to HRS → LRS transition at V-th in the opposite polarity during 0 → -Vmax . The acquired awareness of BRS phenomena in two terminal structures with sandwiched annealed GO thin films is crucial for device designing, specifically for non-volatile memory element in the electronic circuitry.",5,
702,"The top electrode/nclick='CorrectionLayer(0)'>ZrO : nc-Au  n+ Si sandwich struc-tures are fabricated and investigated. The resistive memory with a top Au electrode shows a remarkable self-rectifying effect at LRS, which is suggested to originate from the dif- ferent contact barriers for the asymmetric device structure. A plausible model is also proposed to explain the localized self-rectifying resistive switching behavior. The self- rectifying characteristic at LRS is an attractive property for resistive memory, which shows a potential use to minimize the cross-talk effect and alleviate the misreading in passive crossbar structure arrays.",0,
703,"In conclusion, we have described a FIB cross-sectioning method to directly observe local conductive spots in our polymer memory device. Based on the TEM results, we conclude that the memory mechanism is due to the formation and annihilation of filaments. We also proposed a model to describe the formation of these highly conductive pathways with evidences from STEM-EDS. During the forming process, metal ions are injected into the polymer film by enhanced localized electric field. When a sufficiently high voltage bias is applied to the formed device, highly conductive spots are created by the locally enhanced electric field and high current density. These conductive spots are destroyed by joule heating when a higher voltage is applied to the device. Temperature dependence studies were performed on the device and the results were consistent with our model. Transient current measurement further enhanced our understanding on the switching dynamics of the device.",52,
704,"We have shown that nonuniformities in the device, either intentionally or unintentionally introduced during the fabrication process, are capable of dominating device characteristics. The polymer in our device played only a secondary role in the switching mechanism. There are several reports in the literature describing polymer memories with similar device characteristics but explained by different mechanisms. While it is difficult to generalize our findings to all material systems, we believe that it is necessary to carefully examine the nonuniformities in both the electrode and film when studying the device mechanism.",69,
705,"In summary, we introduced low-toxicity and uniform Cs3Cu2I5 perovskite films as the active layer and successfully fabricated the Ag/Cs3Cu2I5/ITO memristor. In the Ag/Cs3Cu2I5/ITO memristor, unfortunately, the top electrode Ag would easily react with iodide ions and then generate AgIx, thus increasing the defect concentration in the active layer and degradation of the Ag electrode. Such effects would induce a negative set event during the reset process, resulting in the Ag/Cs3Cu2I5/ ITO memristor with poor endurance. To improve the performance of the memristor, the ultrathin PMMA films are introduced as an isolating layer to fabricate the Ag/PMMA/ Cs3Cu2I5/ITO memristor. After optimization, the RS properties of the Ag/PMMA/Cs3Cu2I5/ITO memristor are tested under open-air conditions. The results show that the obtained nonvolatile memristor exhibits bipolar RS with low operating voltage (< ±1 V), large on/off ratio (102), stable endurance (100 cycles), and long retention time (>104 s). It is proven that this strategy successfully avoided the direct contact between the Ag electrode and Cs3Cu2I5 perovskite films and effectively promoted the performance of RS behavior of the memristor. Additionally, the LTP and LTD functions of biological synaptic properties have been investigated. Using the MNIST handwritten recognition data set, simulation based on the above experimental data could reach a handwritten recognition rate of 94%. In conclusion, these low-toxicity memristors with high recognition accuracy show great potential for use in next-generation computing systems.",42,
706,"In conclusion, the plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) process using Ta(OC2H5)5 as a precursor and plasma-activated hydrogen as a reactant was developed to control the oxygen vacancy concentration and the accompanying leakage current density of the tantalum oxide film. Compared with the thermal-atomic-layer-deposited (thermal-ALD) Ta2O5 film, whose oxygen vacancy concentration must be negligible, the leakage current density of the PEALD TaOx film was ~ five orders of magnitude higher, which must have been induced by the high concentration of oxygen vacancies when the hydrogen volume fraction in the reaction gas was 70%. The leakage current of the PEALD film flew according to the Poole-Frenkel mechanism, with a trap depth of 0.53 eV. The possibility of oxygen vacancy concentration control in PEALD TaOx films was also confirmed by the in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of both the Ta4f core and the valence band (VB) lines. The comparison of the XPS-measured low-oxidation-state content of Ta4+ (~5%) and the time-of_xFFFE_flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS)-estimated H-containing species allowed this study to conclude that non-stoichiometry is largely related with the formation of oxygen vacancies rather than Ta-H ones. The oxygen-deficient TaOx layer played a fluent role as the oxygen vacancy source for the resistance switching of the stoichiometric Ta2O5 layer in contact with it. With the help of such positive role of the PEALD TaOx layer, the resistive switching random access memory (ReRAM) performance up to 1.3x106 cycles was confirmed when the repeated switching test was performed in ISPP mode. The retention of the HRS and LRS up to 5 hours was also confirmed at 300oC from the stacked sample. While such positive roles of the oxygen deficient TaOx layer have already been reported using the reactively sputtered oxygen deficient layers, the deposition of the ALD-based oxygen-deficient layer and its performance confirmation is a notable step forward for RS structure integration with such highly industry matured deposition techniques as ALD.",10,
707,"In summary, the temperature dependent resistive switching of a carbon-based memristor has been characterized. Selection of appropriate contact metals and the insertion of an a-COx layer interfaced with an Ag metal electrode allow low power/energy (~6 nW/250 pJ) devices to be realized. The energies of both the deep acceptor and shallow donor trap states responsible for resistive switching in the amorphous carbon devices have been measured. These states occur in the ta-C layer only and are not related to doping. This work has demonstrated a resistive switching mechanism in disordered carbon that requires no electroforming and no conducting filaments. The memory dynamics suggest suitability for these carbon memristors to be used for future technologies such as reservoir computing and neuromorphic sensors.",26,
708,"The temperature dependence of VCNR that develops in I-V curves of Al–Al2O3–Au diodes, with Al2O3 thicknesses between 12 and 54 nm, has been studied between ~180 and 300 K. Al2O3 is formed by anodizing Al films under conditions that increase the defect and impurity concentration in Al2O3. The voltage to establish VCNR at 300 K is 4.5–6 V, independent of Al2O3 thickness. Electroluminescence of Al–Al2O3–Au diodes occurs simultaneously with the development of VCNR in I-V curves. The maximum current of the VCNR characteristic, Imx, decreases as temperature decreases, particularly for the decreasing voltage portion of the I-V curve. Between 220 and 190 K the VCNR characteristic vanishes; currents become erratic and electroluminescence disappears. Raising the temperature above 200–210 K and measuring I-V curves restores the VCNR characteristic. The voltage for maximum current, Vmx, is between 2.5 and 3.0 V at 300 K. It increases by 1.0–1.5 V as temperature decreases. There is a voltage threshold for electroluminescence, Vth, which is 1.5–2.0 V at 300 K, independent of Al2O3 thickness. Vth increases by as much as 1.5 V as temperature decreases. The electroluminescent intensity ratio, IL / IF, is largest in Al–Al2O3–Au diodes with the thinnest Al2O3 layers.",31,
709,"A model of conduction through one or a few filaments is proposed. Formation of VCNR in I-V curves results in positive charge, an Ohmic contact, and a high-field region at the Al–Al2O3 interface. Electroluminescence is due to recombination of electrons injected into an impurity band, which recombine with defects in Al2O3. Vth is determined by the barrier between the Al Fermi level and the impurity band. As temperature decreases, this barrier increases as impurity states are filled by electrons and cannot ionize thermally. Recombination of electrons with defect centers that govern the Ohmic contact at the Al–Al2O3 interface changes the nature of the Ohmic contact and results in the decrease in current when VS Vmx. Restoration of VCNR in I-V characteristics for decreasing voltage is due to the re-establishment of the positive charge distribution at the Al–Al2O3 interface which determines the Ohmic contact.",31,
710,"It has been suggested70 that there are 9 key metrics that define a memory system, of these the on/off ratio, cycle endurance, ruggedness, retention time, read time and rectification are covered above. This leaves write/erase time and power consumption, both of which are tied to the design of the memristive device and how it is operated, the obvious benefit being that they can be tuned for the exact requirement. Retentions time for these devices were short compared to commercial memory devices, but 10 s is enough time for temporary storage during processing and the true memristive nature of the device operation could give rise to applications in neuromorphic devices or analogue computation. Finally, coupling light sensitivity to electrical memory storage opens many possibilities for optical switching applications perhaps by enabling complex computational applications involving both electrical and optical switching in a single passive component.

711,Depth profiling using Raman microscopy with excitation light of different wavelengths and conducting Raman microscopy across the cross section of film layers was applied to characterize polysilicon films. It has been possible to identify crystalline material beneath a surface layer of amorphous silicon in polysilicon deposited at 570 ◦C.,68,
712,"Raman microscopy has confirmed the variation in crystalline structure with depth shown by TEM, in addition to providing information on polysilicon films for which a TEM result was not available. Results indicate that a high deposition temperature gives rise to a structure that varies significantly, but progressively, with layer thickness, intermediate/low deposition temperatures produce layers that vary less significantly but randomly with thickness and a very low deposition temperature yields a material that shows large variations with thickness, changing from amorphous at the surface to crystalline at the interface with the substrate. Such variations may have consequences for micromachined structures containing polysilicon films that have been released from the substrate. Structural variations in the polysilicon can introduce and reveal stress gradients, which can cause the structure to buckle and fracture.",68,
713,"A finite element model was introduced to describe the resistance response of a semiconductor analog memristor based on the drift and diffusion of mobile dopants. An ana- log resistance change in a semiconductor with mobile dop- ants can be achieved via both dopant extraction and the less obvious dopant redistribution within the device. Minor re- sistance changes can be achieved by varying initial concen- tration levels, device geometry, and the dependence of carrier mobility on ion concentration. However, for large re- sistance changes, ion extraction must be considered. The optimal regime for memristor operation is ion extraction pro- vided that ions can be replaced with minimal loss of capacity or damage to the structure as happens in common thin film battery cathode semiconductors.",26,
714,"In summary, the resistance switching memory operations using the bistability in the I–V characteristics of GaN=AlN RTDs were investigated to realize ultrafast nonvolatile memories operating at a picosecond time scale. The I–V characteristics of GaN=AlN RTDs are degraded by the leakage of electrons accumulating in the quantum well from a deep level in the AlN barrier. On the basis of this model, the resistance switching memory operations were performed using appropriate bias voltages. As a result, the number of cycles of repeated measurements corresponding to write– read–erase–read memory operations greater than 9000 and a retention time above 30 h were attained at room temperature, and no mechanical damage was evident. These results show the feasibility of realizing ultrafast nonvolatile memories used for the core processor in normally off computing systems. However, more improvements of the crystal quality and device design of GaN=AlN RTDs are necessary to suppress the small leakage of electrons from the quantum well and realize high-endurance resistance switching memory operations.",0,
715,This work discusses unipolar resistive switching in polycrystalline hexagonal YMnO3 thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition with circular Au or Al top electrodes on unstructured Pt or Pt/Ti bottom electrodes. Resistive switching can be ascribed to the formation and rupture of conductive filament. Endurance of the YMnO3 thin films is improved by choosing an Al top electrode instead of an Au top electrode. Mainly surface roughness and stability of the top electrode determine the endurance. The OFF to ON resistance ratio lies in the order of 104–105 for a chosen electrode size and the good retention properties of YMnO3 thin films make it a potential material for novel resistive switching devices with a huge OFF to ON resistance ratio.,-1,

The switching operation of a selected single NW was satisfactorily achieved without dis_xFFFE_turbing the surrounding ones. The reset current and power could be reduced down to 2.7 nA and 1.3 nW, respectively, by increasing the resistance during the preceding set operation: indeed, the general trend derived from literature is satisfacto_xFFFE_rily extended to the nA range by adding the results obtained on NiO-based NWs. On the other hand, by comparing our results with literature data, we can conclude that the geometri_xFFFE_cal downscaling plays a determinant role in the reduction of the power consumption, only when a limitation of the forming current is achieved, even in nanometric devices.

718,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated the switchable diode effect in the polycrystalline BNT thin films which exhibit good ferroelectric properties. The P-V and I-V curves together certify that the current hysteresis and switchable diode effect are mainly triggered by the ferroelectric polarization modulated Schottky-like barriers of Pt/BNT interfaces. The retention capacity measurement indicates that the switchable diodes with resistive ON/OFF ratio as high as 3 orders, which indicates that the polycrystalline BNT thin films, would be a candidate for non-volatile resistive memories applications.",-1,

721,"In summary, we have demonstrated two types of resistance switching in the Ag/ZnO/Pt structure, which are accompanied by hysteretic and rectifying I–V characteristics. The changes in the structure of the ZnO layer, occurred during switching, were investigated by PL measurements. The bipolar resistance switching and corresponding increase/decrease of the luminescence signal in the ultraviolet region were attributed to the Agþ ions migration. The monopolar resistance switching accompanied by changes in the visible emission band was, in turn, attributed to generation/recovery of oxygen vacancies in ZnO.",7,
722,"In summary, we have demonstrated an effective method to control the CF growth process in the solid- electrolyte-based ReRAM by using metal NCs covering the bottom electrode. On the basis of TEM image analy- sis, we conclude that CFs grow easily along the direc- tion of the metal NC, which enables their formation along the same path during repeating RS cycles. The NC-guided CF growth reduces the randomness of the CF formation and rupture processes, leading to im- provement of stability and uniformity of CF-based ReRAM. This work provides a feasible way to control the CF formation path by metal NC or other electric- field-concentrating initiators. Furthermore, the size of the electric-field-concentrating initiators can be further reduced by using self-assembly or grain-boundary- mediated diffusion methods, leading to devices with well-controlled filament formation even at sub-10 nm scale.",18,

The maximum modulation of Fano resonance is observed at the pump fluence of 350 J/cm2 (red curve in Fig. 5D), which is slightly higher compared to the quartz substrate (250 J/cm2 ). This difference in pump fluence arises due to the change in substrate (polyimide and quartz), which results in changing the morphology of perovskite thin film. The device flexibility and performance was further investigated by bending the structures to introduce the curvature in the metasurface, which is denoted by . Figure 5 (E to G) shows the robustness of the flexible metadevice, where modulation of Fano resonance remains invariant irrespective of different curvatures 1 and 2. offers many advantages in terms of device stability, low cost, and facile fabrication to push the THz applications toward large commercial scale, particularly where real-time control and manipulation of THz radiation, such as short-range wireless THz communication, ultrafast wavefront control, and photodetectors, is required.",12,

The analog circuit-based STDP design also has the features of efficient transistor cost, low power consumption, and intrinsic tolerance for process variations. Hence, the proposed system and the corresponding simulations are an important tool toward the realization of highly efficient, large-scale neuronal networks based on advanced nanodevices with typical experimentally observed nonideal characteristics. Our results could also benefit applications such as neuromorphic robots, context understanding, and video processing.",39,
725,"In conclusion, devices composed of a Cu-ZnO nanowire-Cu sandwich structure have been characterized over a wide dynamic range. An electromechanical model has been postulated to explain the resistive switching behavior of the devices. Electromechanical re-location of nanowire clusters is thought to be the cause of resistive switching behavior observed at low frequencies. At high frequencies, the nanowires could not respond fast enough because of the large damping force in the nanowire cluster, and hence geometrical capacitance between nanowires dominated. The bandpass resistive switching behavior of the device is therefore attributed to the mechanical resonance of the nanowires. The nonlinearity of various resistance states was the result of the back-to-back Schottky barriers between nanowire boundaries.",9,

Such lattice strains effectively reduce the energy barrier for magnetic reversal domain nucleation through electronic/domain structure interactions, resulting in noticeable decrease of the reversal nucleation field and the HC value (tunability by 80%). Moreover, the HC tunability is nonvolatile and reversible due to the characteristics of shape memory effect in the substrate.",-1,
727,"In summary, we fabricated NiO nanowire array devices with different cell sizes or different diameters using the AAO templates formed on the Si substrates. The nanowire array devices exhibited unipolar resistive switching behav- iors, and the switching parameters were reduced with decreasing cell size. These devices also showed the scaling behaviors IRESET / R_0 and B3f / R_0 , independently of the cell size. However, the scaling exponent a was dependent on the nanowire diameter. The larger a was found for the smaller nanowire diameter, leading to the smaller fractal dimension of D_f for the smaller nanowire diameter. On the other hand, the scaling exponent c was independent of the nanowire diameter, as expected from scaling theory in which c is independent of D_f . The decrease in D_f was possibly ascribed to the localization of conducting paths within each nanowire",49,
728,"In conclusion, we have described the electroforming process in metal-oxide nanodevices made of TiO2, Al2O3, and HfO2 oxides combined with Au, Ni, Ti, and Pt electrodes. In total, more than 1300 devices have been exposed to sequences of electrical stimuli (i.e., RVS, CVS, and PVS) and the experimental results have been compared with theoretical calculations via multiscale modeling software (i.e., GinestraTM). Our study reveals that the evolution of the currents driven before electroforming, the electroforming time, and the presence and quality of bipolar RS after electroforming strongly depend on the method used to deposit the insulating material. The use of sputtered oxides and Ni electrodes seems to facilitate post-electroforming bipolar RS when electrical stimuli of reverse polarities are applied, the use of Au electrodes increases the electroforming voltage, and the use of Pt electrodes slows down the electroforming process, which is manifested by a plateau region in the I−t curves. Finally, we systematically observed that CVS and PVS are much more suitable than RVS to characterize electroforming, as the shape of the I−t curves can anticipate the presence of postelectroforming bipolar RS in the devices. These findings should be valuable for designers of neuromorphic systems, as they provide important insights into which materials, synthesis processes, and characterization strategies are the most suitable.",56,
729,"In this paper, we presented the resistive switching characteristics of HfO2 based OxRAM by using C-AFM in the vacuum environment. Samples with different bottom electrodes were studied by using AFM tips (Full diamond and PtSi) as the top electrode for the MIM structure. The results were analyzed using a phenomenological model assuming that the current is limited by a constriction in a conductive filament in the On state after forming. In the Off state, the constriction is open, giving rise to a gap whose length and barrier limit the tunneling current. The effect of different tip materials and sizes on switching characteristics was particularly studied. There was not much effect of the tip material on the I-V switching characteristics although there was a strong effect of sharp and blunt AFM tips. With sharp tips, one observed lower Off state currents and larger SET and RESET voltages which present large fluctuations with cycling. With blunt tips, the I-V characteristics presented higher Off state current comparable to devices and reproducible switching characteristics. SEM-EDX measurements on the full diamond AFM tip have shown the presence of Ti on the blunt tips only after electrical measurements. These facts consistently with the model based analysis led us to assume that the differences between blunt and sharp tips may be explainable if the metallic filament constriction is located near the top electrode tip contact. For sharp tips, the Off state tunneling current barrier is consistent with a (Pt or C tip)/HfO2/Ti (filament) interface as for blunt tip and devices with the Ti/TiOx/Ti interface. The difference in tunneling barrier characteristic was explained by the effect of the slight tip shift. For devices, this constriction was assumed in the vicinity of the bottom electrode. This geometrical difference leads to variations of the electron flux transmission factor that accounts well for larger set voltages in the case of AFM tips compared to devices. The larger reset voltages observed for CAFM were explained by the shallower filament constriction position and assumed to be linked to the higher breakdown electric field. Finally, we did not observe any significant effect of polarity on switching characteristics, including forming with CAFM. Since Ti was present only in bottom electrodes, the Titanium concentration gradient is likely the driving force in the forming process. Ti migration during forming from high Ti concentration electrodes to low Ti concentration in a preexisting hot breakdown percolation path might explain the differences in the geometrical position and geometry of the filament constriction.",62,
730,"The temperature dependence of the resistance of GeTe/ Sb2Te3-superlattice-based iPCM devices was measured, demonstrating thermal stability up to 200 °C. It was shown that the peculiar behavior of the SET and RESET resistances of iPCM devices at elevated temperature is a feature unique to the GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattice as opposed to the GST alloy, underscoring the fundamental differences in the structure and switching process. These differences may be useful for the development of multilevel encoding memory devices. The appearance of additional resistance levels in iPCM at T > 150 °C was shown.",0,
731,"In summary, by fabricating the Au/PMMA/PMMA:MoS2 QDs/PMMA/FTO device, the memory effects of MoS2 QDs embedded in the insulating PMMA were confirmed with the excellent read endurance, retention capability, and large resistance ratio. Meanwhile, the unique quantum conductance phenomenon was also observed in this MoS2 QD memory device. Based on the energy band evolution, the origin of memory effects and quantum conductance was clearly understood taking trapping/de-trapping and quantum tunneling effects of nanoscale MoS2 QDs into account. This work also indicates the potential application of MoS2 QDs in data storage.",66,
732,"As a possible model of the CER effect, we proposed that a charging effect at the Schottky-like interface composed of a metal and an insulating perovskite oxide modifies the potential profile of the barrier.""' Other research groups have proposed an electrochemical migration of oxygen ions at the interface as the origin of resistance bistability."",12 According to the electrochemical migration model, it would also occur at Ti/LSMO interfaces when a large electric field is applied. In our experiments, however, the metal-to-metal contact of the Ti/LSMO interface shows no CER effect and the insertion of such thin insulating SCMO layers as n=1-5 at the interface induces the CER effect. Therefore, electrochemical migration mechanism alone cannot count for the experimental results. It is natural to think that the insulating properties of perovskite manganites play an important role as an electronic origin of the CER effect. From the SCMO thickness dependence on the CER properties, we infer that the charging effect at the trapping sites within several u.c. modifies the electronic properties of the junction.",2,
733,"In summary, we have studied the CER effect of the Ti/Smo. Cap.3MnO3(n u.c.)/Lao. Sro.3MnO3 [Ti/SCMO(n)/ LSMO] junctions. No CER effect takes place at the metalto-metal contact of the Ti/LSMO junction, while the insertion of thin insulating SCMO layers at the Ti/LSMO interface induces the CER effect. These experimental results support an electronic origin of the CER effect. Also, the active layer thickness of the perovskite manganites for the CER effect is shown to be several u.c.",2,
734,"In this sense, our results appear qualitatively coherent with the usual description of SET and RESET processes in filamentary memristive devices. On the other hand, it must be cited that, in literature, results that move away from ours can be found regarding filamentary systems involving similar, as well as different materials. For instance, gradual transitions for both SET and RESET dynamics over a window of more that 3 (¼Rmax/Rmin) have been found in filamentary devices based on a Ta2O5-x/TaOy bilayer structure.11 For what concerns HfO2-based memristors, contrasting results can be found. For instance, the groups of Professor Nishi and Professor Wong found a nice gradual RESET behavior over a significant resistance range driven by repeated identical pulses in a Pt/HfOx/TiOx/HfOx/TiOx/TiN as well as in Pt/ HfO2/TiN devices in two separate publications17,32 and did not report about any gradual transition for SET operation. Gao et al. first reported preliminary observations on the pulse repetition number on the resistance change on TiN/HfO2/Pt devices,20 as later confirmed by the present authors.23 On the other hand, few works on HfO2-based memristors demonstrate gradual SET and RESET operations as function of the number of pulse repetitions.5,19,34",-1,
735,"This literature survey demonstrates that fully understanding the switching dynamics in memristor is still a matter of study, and with the present manuscript, we present the details of TiN/HfO2/Pt switching dynamics for SET and RESET in different voltage conditions. The results have been discussed in terms of the relations among the thermo-electrochemical effects of Joule heating, ion mobility, and resistance change, which provide a positive and negative closed loop processes in SET and RESET, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of a competition between opposite tendencies of filament dissolution and formation at opposite metal/HfO2 interfaces is supposed to play a role in determining the observed dynamics. Related to this competition is the demonstration of forming and SET processes conducted without any current limitation, which constitutes a possibly interesting breakthrough for many practical applications, even though the reduction of the involved current still must be addressed.",28,
736,"In this paper, we have shown that the PBD event occurs in the case of MOS devices consisting of two and three layers of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and hafnium oxide (HfO2) by means of a highbandwidth setup. To clarify the role of the interfaces in the heat dissipation from the BD path to its surroundings, a systematic analysis of the BD transients was performed in those samples. Taking into account the literature, the BD current growth rate was proposed as an adequate magnitude to measure the heat dissipation during the BD event since it is strongly related to the thermal conductivity of the dielectric layer. Overall results showed no differences in the PBD growth rate indicating a negligible impact of the interfaces on the temperature profiles around the CF despite the number of interfaces.",49,
737,"Although the role played by material interfaces in the heat dissipation in nanoscaled devices is well documented, our results show no clear impact of oxide–oxide interfaces on the BD transients. This suggests that the capabilities of the stack to dissipate the heat produced during BD, which drives the PBD growth, away from the BD path are solely defined by the bulk materials involved.",20,
738,"This observation goes in strong favor of the formation of a CF (probably due to atom electromigration from the electrodes) with electrical characteristics that are not influenced by the number of oxide interfaces in the multilayered stack. This concept was shown by QPC model fits, consistent with the idea of a variable energy barrier at the center of the filament constriction. The case of partially formed percolation paths is considerably different, since most of the power is dissipated at the interfaces within the percolation path itself and the surrounding insulator, where energy barriers limit the carrier transport into and out of the filament.",58,
739,"In addition to their relevance for the scaling of gate dielectrics in modern CMOS devices, our results may provide a basic framework for different applications of ultra-thin dielectrics, in particular, for the electrically induced resistive switching effects which have been proposed as the basis for future semiconductor nonvolatile memories.",0,
740,"In summary, highly oriented (-111) HZO films are potential storage materials in metal-insulator-metal resistive switching memory devices with superior bistable bipolar RS behavior. Experimental measurements show that highly oriented HZO devices have lower switching voltages and a superior retention time of 105 s without significant degradation. These devices can perform robust multivalue data storage at room temperature and achieve better biosynaptic functions and plasticity. The highly oriented HZO device has simple fabrication processes and excellent electrical performance in nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computation applications.",-1,

742,"In conclusion, the electric transport properties of poly- crystalline BFO films prepared by a sol-gel method have been investigated by means of I-V and c-AFM measure- ments. The resistance switching behaviors without the form- ing process are found in the BFO films annealed at and above 650 °C. The c-AFM and retention measurements sug- gest that the redistribution of oxygen vacancies in grain boundaries under an electric field plays a key role on the resistance switching behaviors.",4,
743,"In summary, this study investigated the RS mechanism of PCMO thin films by analyzing RS I-V curves and valence band spectra of epitaxial-grown PCMO (110) films on STO (001) substrates. To intrinsically observe changes in the interface between TE and PCMO in the RS process without damage to the PCMO surface, we adopted an Hg liquid drop as the TE. After the “forming process” was initiated through repeated I-V sweeps, the Hg drop/PCMO (110)/STO (001) exhibit a counterclockwise bipolar RS curve, and the measured LRS and HRS curves exhibit different behavior in the trap-filled-limited region under both applied positive and negative voltage. The difference in I-V behavior between LRS and HRS can be attributed to the electrochemical migration model in PCMO film via applied electric field. The interpreted RS mechanism was also confirmed with valence band spectrum analysis.",19,
744,"In conclusion, the spatial distribution of the oxygen vacancies under electric field in different resistance states was revealed in the Ti/HfOx/Pt device, based on the comparison of the XPS spectra of Hf 4f signal between Ti/HfOx interface and HfOx/Pt interface, accompanying with thickness information shown by cross-sectional TEM image. A dynamic model of oxygen vacancies migration was proposed to explain the RS mechanism in the Ti/HfOx/Pt device. This model suggests that the rupture and connection of oxygen vacancies formed conducting paths occur near the HfOx/Pt interface. The RS process relates to both interfaces near the TE and BE. Our study could provide extended deep understanding on the ion migration in RRAMs with the simple MIM structure.",10,
745,"The current status of nonvolatile semiconductor memory technology was overviewed. The author introduced only a small portion of the various memories being proposed, and many other innovative ideas are being proposed and reported. The International Technology Roadmap for Semi conductors (ITRS)81) publishes an annual report focusing on various technologies, such as semiconductor technology and fabrication technology. In the report, the nonvolatile semi conductor memories introduced in this article are classified using three tables. One is the main table summarizing the memories that have already been used in practice, such as flash memories, FeRAM, and MRAM,82) and PRAM has recently been added to this table. This may be an appropriate decision considering the fact that the shipping of sample PRAMs has started.",23,
746,"The second table is a detailed classification of emerging research on resistance-based memory devices currently being studied, which particularly emphasizes their categorization.83) Most types of ReRAM and organic memories are included in this table. However, this table suffers from a lack of space, and it is difficult to compare the given performance indices. This is because ReRAMs and organic memories operate on the basis of various types of mechanisms, and this difficulty of comparison is expected to continue for the time being. The memories whose operating principles have been clarified, such as ferroelectric gate transistors, are summarized in the third table,84) from which the issues yet to be resolved can be clearly understood.",23,
747,"In addition, there is the Transition Table,85) which illustrates the technologies that are expected to be included or excluded from the above three tables in the future; i.e., memories that may be added to the main table if their research and development progresses, and those that may be excluded from the table because of the lack of progress in research are listed in the Transition Table. In 2007, single electron memory was excluded from the main table and removed from the evaluation targets.",23,
748,"The future of new types of nonvolatile memory can be understood by following the discussion on the ITRS website, which is available to everyone, and we recommend that readers study the Roadmap thoroughly. To replace the practically used types of memory listed in the main table, new memories are required to have significant advantages. In the future, various applications of electronic equipment will be continuously developed, and various types of memory are thereby required for a ubiquitous-computing society. Flash memories are highly advantageous in specific fields but have some weaknesses. There is still room for the development of new types of nonvolatile memory, including ReRAM, that can compensate for the weaknesses of flash memories.",23,
749,"For their practical application, nonvolatile memories must demonstrate a reliable nonvolatile performance. Performance reliability must be ensured for ten years in general; however, nonvolatile memories will not be commercially successful if it takes ten years to confirm the performance reliability. Thus, accelerated aging tests are needed. This is an inherent problem of nonvolatile memories.",23,
750,"For an accurate estimation of memory performance in an accelerated aging test, we must precisely understand the physics underlying the deterioration due to accelerated aging. To this end, the operating principles of a device and its underlying physics must be understood. These requirements raise the hurdle for nonvolatile memories in terms of reliability much more than for other electronic devices. The operation of many of the nonvolatile memories currently being proposed is based on new principles, and therefore, they must overcome this high hurdle before practical application. This is why it has taken a long time to commercialize FeRAMs and MRAMs for practical use and why these memories are still struggling in the market. To practically apply new types of nonvolatile semiconductor memory, we need a different way of thinking; that is, we must foster their technology by exploring new application fields with fewer difficulties to achieve the mass production of such memories for use in these fields.",23,
751,"Self-assembled 3-D MoS2 microspheres have been deliberately synthesized by using the hydrothermal method. Different from the conventional nano-scale RS memory device, the micro-scale device with an Ag/MoS2/ITO structure is developed at room temperature. Bipolar RS memory effects presenting a favourable ON/OFF ratio ~10^4, stability, and retention time are observed in the developed device. The formation and rupture of a localized conduction Ag filament, charge trapping and detrapping from the space charge region, and establishment and destruction of a boundary-based hopping path may co-contribute to the observed RS memory behaviours.",66,
752,"A reliable and flexible resistive memory Al/GO/ITO/ PET was investigated for possible NVM applications. A typical bipolar reliable and reproducible resistive switching behavior was demonstrated. The memory cell has a good retention performance and does not need any forming process. The speed of the SET and RESET operations of GO based RRAM was explored, and the SET operation was found to be significantly slower than the RESET operation. Programming speed difference between the SET and RESET process is elucidated by voltage controlled oxygen diffusion coefficient change.",6,
753,"We have demonstrated intercalation-based Li1 – xNbO2 nonvolatile memristors that are inherently non-binary, highly scalable, and energy efficient. Using the substantiated Li intercalation mechanism, we show flexibility in device operation with volatile, semi-volatile, and non-volatile devices from within the same material family simply with variations in the fabrication protocol. The non-volatile memristor characteristics can be modified by Li1 – xNbO2 stoichiometry (doping), crystal orientation (alignment of intercalation planes to the electric fields), and device geometry. This multi-functional memristive system combined with the high scalability due to the intercalation process enables high-density neuromorphic circuitry. In addition, we have demonstrated nonvolatile memristor programming with a mere 150 mV of electrical bias at micro-Watts of DC power, both of which could be improved by fabricating nanoscale devices for even lower programming potentials with the possibility of millivolt operation and using microsecond pulsing for ultra-low energy operation. While power supply noise may impose a lower limit on the operation of these low voltage devices, there is ample design flexibility in the length to width ratios and in the absolute size of the devices to provide many ranges of operation from several tens of volts to millivolts. As device sizes are reduced, the resistance change increases. Thus, some optimization is needed for each desired operational voltage. Additionally, nontraditional architectures are being considered that involve deeply embedded network loops where the effect of power supply noise on individual devices is not as severe. Although noise fluctuations in power supplies may hinder millivolt operation and CMOS integration challenges could require new computing architectures to make full use of the low-power advantages, the high scalability, ultra-low voltage operation, and flexibility in timescale of these devices establish Li1 – xNbO2 memristors as a promising candidate for applications in neuromorphic computation.",8,
754,"To summarize, the cycling-induced endurance failure issue was carefully understood by monitoring the I-V curves for all RS cycles. A negative SET event was observed after continuous normal RS cycles and eventually triggers endurance failure in Pt/HfOx/Pt devices. The appearance of the intermediate resistance state at the initial stage of the negative SET cycle indicates a conspicuous reduction of EA0, which accounts for the appearance of a negative SET with increasing RS cycles. More importantly, we recovered the devices from endurance",-1,
755,"failure by moderate OPT, which can provide the available O2 in RS cycles. Meaningfully, the first recovered devices after endurance failure can be recovered again through OPT, which better proves the validity of the recovery method.

758,"In conclusion, we succeeded to grow SrTiO3 films with widely different defect structures using PLD. SrTiO3 thin films, grown in a layer-by-layer grow mode with a Ti/Sr ratio close to 1 exhibit a defect structure and conductivity pattern close to single crystals. Irregularly distributed resistive switching, conducting spots were observed in an insulating matrix and might be identified with exits of dislocations, that extend across the sample and intersect with the surface. For Ti-rich films grown at low pressure, a coherent 3D growth mode was obtained. The significant surface feature of these films is a short-range-order of well-conducting surface hills. These regular arrays of conducting hills can be regarded as single resistive switching units. Both, the size and the distribution of these conducting hills, resemble regular networks of threading dislocations. For Ti-rich films grown at higher pressure in a kinetically more restricted island growth mode, we were able to identify defect-rich island boundaries with conducting ring structures on the surface: each island boundary can be seen as a well conducting region, while the less defective island centers are nonconducting and not involved in the switching process. The observed nanoscale switching behavior is consistent with a voltage driven oxygen vacancy movement that induces a local metal to insulator transition. The transition occurs preferentially in defect-rich regions of the investigated samples containing an increased concentration of oxygen vacancies and acting as easy-diffusionchannels. Our results demonstrate the possibility to modify the local distribution of resistive switching channels by choosing appropriate deposition routes and are thereby a first step toward the realization of defect engineered SrTiO3 thin films.",2,
759,"A model of characteristics of ReRAMs based on a charge transport among localized electric states has been presented. The concept of dual energy gap for a hopping has been introduced to the model. This model has revealed the underlying mechanism of resistance dispersion and fluctuation including distribution-tails and random telegraph signal noise. The Current fluctuation of a ReRAM is attributed to the dispersion of hopping being based on a stochastic process varying from time to time. This is the first model which explains such characteristics totally in a simple conduction model. The fluctuation is compensated by an increased number of sub-filaments in a CF. The number of SFs and the appearance ratio of the different hopping energies at a site are the key factors for a stable Set resistance. The HRS will be generated by an increased inter-sites distance d which is larger around two or three times than that of LRS. The switching mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the insight of the CF structure. Abrupt transition at a Set-process from HRS to LRS is initiated by the threshold switching. Successively, the ion drift is accelerated by the increased electric field, forms the CF. The driving force of Reset is also the drift rather than lateral diffusion of ions. The resistance fluctuation and gradual increase during a Reset-process are explained in conjunction with the number of hopping site in a conduction filament. This model will provide a strong tool for investigation of electrical characteristics and a structure of filament and will be applicable not only for ReRAMs but also for phase change memories.",-1,
760,"In summary we have fabricated a Ag/PZT/PCMO/ YBCO resistance switching device by inserting a PZT thin layer at the Ag/PCMO interface. By making a comparison between PZT-buffered and nonbuffered devices with the same PCMO/YBCO bilayer, we have shown that the former exhibits a much greater EPIR ratio and has a significantly lower threshold of the pulse voltage. The EPIR switching effect is attributed to the pulse-induced resistance change of the depletion regions with the ferroelectric polarization of the PZT buffer playing a crucial role in the enhanced EPIR ratio. The pulse-driven oxygen ion/vacancy motion model is suggested for the EPIR effect of the nonbuffered devices, with the movement of the oxygen ions exhibiting a ferroelectriclike behavior and resulting in the resistance change of the depletion regions induced by opposite pulse polarities.",17,
761,"In conclusion, we demonstrated a high-performance flexible PVP/PMF electrolyte-based atomic switching device with excellent bipolar switching characteristics and device stability. The lowest SET/RESET voltages were 0.25 and -0.5 V, respectively, and the on/off-current ratio was 10^5. Moreover, the maximum cyclic endurance was more than 10^3 and the HRS/LRS retention time guaranteed approximately 10 years. These were achieved by two key techniques: ( i ) the adjustment of the number of cross-linked chains in the PVP/PMF electrolyte to modulate Cu-ion diffusion and electrical insulating property and ( ii ) the insertion of a Ti-buffer layer to control the number of diffused Cu ions and to supply electrons into the PVP/PMF electrolyte. FT-IR and AFM analyses showed that the number of cross-linked chains in the PVP/PMF electrolyte increased as the composite ratio of PMF to PVP increased from 50 to 150%. Increasing the number of cross-linked chains reduced the number of sites for Cu-ion diffusion and improved the insulating property, thereby increasing the SET voltage from 0.45 V ( 50% ) to 0.8 V ( 100% ) and reducing the off-current level from 6 × 10^-5 A ( 50% ) to 6 × 10^-8 A ( 100% ). However, the 150% PVP/PMF device did not operate properly as a bipolar switch. In addition, by inserting a Ti-buffer layer under the Cu electrode, we improved both the bipolar switching properties and device stability. Because the Ti buffer acted as a diffusion barrier for Cu ions, the Ti-buffer layer reduced the diameter of the conduction filaments. This thereby decreased the off-current and RESET voltage ( Ioff: 1.68 × 10^-6 → 4.22 × 10^-10 A and Vreset: -0.9 → -0.5 V ) and improved the maximum cyclic endurance ( 4 × 102 → 10^3 ). The diameter of the conduction filaments was experimentally confirmed by CAFM analysis. On the basis of this analysis, the diameter was reduced from 4932.7 to 692.04 nm^2 by inserting a Ti-buffer layer. Moreover, the Tibuffer layer with a lower standard electrode potential than that of the Cu electrode more easily released electrons into the PVP/PMF electrolyte consequently reducing the activation energy required to form conduction filaments ( Vset: 0.5 → 0.2 V ) and suppressing oxidation of conduction filament ( retention time: 10^3 → 10^4 at RT ). Finally, we implemented logic AND and OR circuits with the PVP/PMF atomic switches, which were appropriately operated at low voltages below 2 V. As shown in the performance comparison table ( Table 1 ), our atomic switching device exhibited better device performance than that of the previously reported polymer-based atomic switches. In addition, logic circuit applications based on polymer atomic switches have not been reported to date. In particular, the low operating voltage below 2 V of our logic circuits was much lower than that ( > 5 V ) of the circuits configured by polymer resistive random access memory. Through this research, we thus demonstrated the feasibility of PVP/PMF-based atomic switches to flexible integrated circuits for next-generation electronic applications.",9,
762,"In summary, we studied the polarity dependent resistive switching characteristics of asymmetric Au/TiO_2/Cu junctions exhibiting memristive properties. We considered both polarities electroforming and studied their electrical features (both dynamical and remanent response to voltage pulses) and their temperature dependence. We showed the determinant role of the electroforming polarity on TiO_2 based memory devices, which produces the migration of either Cu or OV to develop conducting filaments. Besides, a device with three stable states (LR+, IR, and HR+) was obtained after a single electroforming procedure.",28,
763,"In summary, bipolar RS properties were obtained in Pt/ Ti/E-BSTO/Ir and Pt/Ti/NE-BSTO/Ir devices. Unlike the reported set or reset process, continuous resistance change was obtained for both devices. According to the experiments, conducting domains model was proposed to explain the RS origin of the devices, in which the rearrangement of oxygen vacancies under the electrical field formed the conducting domains. The switching of conducting domains led to the RS process. The resistance switching ratio of Pt/Ti/E-BSTO/Ir was bigger than that of Pt/Ti/NE-BSTO/Ir, which was resulted from the more quantity of conducting domains and the farther migration distance of oxygen vacancies in conducting domains of E-BSTO thin film.",19,
764,"In summary, we studied the resistive switching of Au/ BiFeO3/SrRuO3 structures. Their I–V characteristics showed that a full cycle of the poling process enlarged the I–V hysteresis loop at a sweeping bias less than the coercive voltage, producing a high resistance switching ratio and increasing the transition voltage from Ohmic to SCL. Measurements of thermally stimulated current revealed that after positive poling, the change of trap filling status contributed to the enhanced resistive switching. We attributed the effect of poling on RS to the increase in activated trap levels caused by carrier trapping/detrapping in the poling process based on the resistive switching mechanism.",-1,
765,A multi-level PCRAM device was fabricated using a multi-layer phase change material stack. This stack consisted of NGST and GST layers sandwiching a Ta2O5 barrier layer. Electrical characterization was performed to demonstrate the multi-level resistance behavior. Resistance windows of at least 1 order in magnitude between consecutive states were achieved. The stability and reproducibility of the multi-level states indicate that these PCRAM devices are suitable for multi-bit high density storage. The voltage pulses used to switch the device to a respective state were found to be independent of the previous state of the device. Thermal analysis was also performed to better understand the mechanics of the multi-level switching phenomenon. This work demonstrates the feasibility of these multi-level PCRAM devices as well as the physics behind the multi-level switching abilities of these devices.,-1,
766,"In conclusion, current fluctuations at HRS, MRS, and LRS were studied in detail through RTN method. Twolevel RTN signal with an amplitude of 40.7% was clearly observed at HRS. By extracting the dominant trap near the CF that causes the RTN signal, we found that the trap located 0.039 eV lower than Fermi level. The trapping/detrapping process exhibits 1/f 2 behavior in the PSD. An envelope of RTN signals with amplitude of 34.0% was observed in MRS, which was caused by multiple traps near the CF, leading to 1/f shape in PSD analysis. And for LRS, a small fluctuation of 0.3% was observed which was caused by a number of traps nearby/in the CF. The envelope of RTN signals results in the 1/f trend of normalized noise in the frequency domain.",-1,
767,"In summary, we have shown PLD-grown SrTi0.95- Fe0.05O3 thin films to contain Fe3þ and a high degree of Fe3þ-V O associates in the as-deposited state. We demonstrate through micro-focused XANES on a resistively switched MIM structure that electroforming increases the Fe-V O concentration homogeneously over the whole electrode area until local breakdown is achieved. FMS XANES calculations suggest that the observed XANES in the region of the conducting filament can be interpreted by the association of two oxygen vacancies to Fe in the filament region.",2,
768,"In summary, we fulfill the large number of requirements for efficient neuromorphic computing in a single organic ECRAM device: linear resistance tuning with a >2× dynamic range, fast switching (20 ns), submicrosecond write-read cycling, low-voltage (±1 V) and low-energy (~80 fJ per write) operation, low noise (△G2 /δ2 > 100), and excellent endurance both at room temperature and at elevated temperature (>109 write-read operations at 90°C). Our materials selection strategy proves to be quite general, as it can be effectively implemented using various ionic liquids and other block copolymers (fig. S7). In contrast, it has been proven difficult to optimize PCMs and ReRAMs across all metrics, such as attaining both low write noise and low current operation, which are needed for scaling to large arrays.While this work represents a fundamental step toward designing organic ECRAMs to be compatible with fabrication into high-density synaptic arrays, some important challenges remain due to the strict temperature and contamination requirements for integration with CMOS. Alternative fabrication pathways exist for integrating emerging nonvolatile memories with CMOS, such as low-temperature monolithic 3D integration of carbon nanotubes and ReRAMs, and remain an active area of pursuit to improve such compatibility. Last, we emphasize that the ECRAM concept is not limited to organic materials. The lessons learned here, such as the importance of mobile species infiltrating the channel before electrochemical gating and possibly relying on proton conduction for fast switching, can also benefit ECRAMs made with other ion intercalation materials such as 2D materials, van der Waals heterostructures, or MXene composites.",51,
769,"ZnO NWs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method on pþ-Si substrate with ZnO seed layer to fabricate a pn junction structure. The I–V curves of the resulting Ti/ZnONWs/ZnO-seed-layer/pþ-Si substrate exhibited diode characteristics as well as hysteresis under reverse bias. The current gradually increased and then became saturated during repeated þV sweeps. Notably, the current further increased after sweeping –V. Subsequently, the current was decreased back by þV sweep. The polarity dependent resistance change, i.e., decreasing resistance with application of –V and increasing resistance with application of þV in analog fashion, remained the same during pulse measurement. From the C–V curves, which exhibited hysteresis between the forward and backward sweeps, and conduction mechanism analysis, the modulation of depletion region by redistribution of oxygen vacancies and the presence of space charges may have induced the observed analog resistive switching. In addition, the bipolar switching of SET at þV and RESET at –V was observed after the forming operation. These results demonstrate the potential application of ZnO NWs-based pn junctions to both analog and digital bipolar resistive switching devices.",7,
770,"In summary, we investigated the conduction mechanism of SiNx-based devices and the effect of the top electrode thickness on RS behavior. High electrode thickness devices showed a self-compliant bipolar RS behavior that has good repeatability. However, the low electrode thickness devices displayed unstable RS characteristics and high set voltages. Ohmic conduction has been found to take place in the LRS, while Schottky emission occurs in the HRS. The nitrogen accommodation ability of the top electrode is used to explain the different RS behaviors in the two device types. Thicker top electrodes allow for a larger nitrogen reservoir, while thin top electrodes have a smaller nitrogen reservoir, which causes the nitrogen ions to become unstable when combining with Ta. From the model, it seems that the migration of nitrogen ions, Si-DBs, and the distribution of the electric field are the major factors affecting RS behavior.",10,
771,"In conclusion, the main source which controls the Gp/u peak frequency position is the surface potential associated to the surface state charges on Nb:STO crystal. Therefore, an impoverishment of negative charge from the Nb:STO interface traps, by tunneling electrons to the Pt TE during the forward biasing, results in a decrease of the surface potential uS, and consequently, the associated decrease in s manifests the Gp/u peak at higher up. In such condition the device evolves to LRS. Reciprocally, a raise of the surface potential uS, by injection of electrons from Pt TE to the Nb:STO interface traps during the reverse biasing, results in a decrease of s that lets up appear at low frequency. In such condition the device evolves to HRS.",-1,
772,"In conclusion, our insights derived from in situ TEM analysis provide an explanation for the long-debated anomalous eightwise switching and coexistence of two switching polarities in oxide memristive devices. In our model material SrTiO3, electrochemical oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, rather than the typically invoked internal redistribution of oxygen-vacancies, give rise to eightwise switching. While oxygen evolution has already been accepted as a mechanism for electroforming, the reincorporation of oxygen (i.e., the oxygen reduction reaction) has long been neglected in this material system and in resistive switching oxides in general. However, the observed difference in total oxygen-vacancy concentration between the LRS and HRS provides indisputable Adv. Mater.",45,
773,"In summary, this work provides evidence of the EB and bistable MR states in the a-TbFeCo thin films. The EB is closely related to the two growth-induced nanoscale phases distributed throughout the film, which were observed using STEM-EDS and APT. This biased thin film has many appealing properties such as the large PMA and room-temperature capability. Moreover, the amorphous thin film requires no epitaxial growth and specific substrates. The bistable MR states associated with the EB are proved to be stable at room temperature and switchable by sweeping the magnetic field. More tunability of the EB and bistable MR states can be achieved with a wide range of alloy compositions and controllable growth of nanoscale phases. Further efforts are under progress to vary the sputter deposition parameters and study the tuning of magnetic properties as a function of deposition conditions. Recently, all-optical switching (AOS) using ultrafast laser has been discovered in a-TbFeCo thin films.5, Our findings also imply that the biased a-TbFeCo thin film may be potential for the new AOS devices.",4,
774,"In summary, nanoscale resistive switching devices with intrinsic diode characteristics were fabricated and tested. The devices show write/erase endurance > 10^8 , on/ off > 10^6 , programming speed < 50 ns and retention > 4 years. The intrinsic diode characteristics are reliable and can provide a possible solution to suppress crosstalk in crossbar memory or logic arrays.",0,
775,"In conclusion, we introduced a low-temperature treatment method to repair failed devices to their previous operational performance. During the treatment process, H2O molecules in a supercritical phase were introduced into the Hf:SiO2 layer, where they repair the oxygen vacancies and provide more oxygen ions that can be accessed during the set=reset process. Results of comparison indicated that the electrical characteristics after treatment were almost the same as those before failure, not only in the DC I–V sweep, but also the endurance and retention properties. By analyzing the fitting results, we proposed a model to explain the effect of the treatment. These results demonstrate that such a SCCO2 treatment is an effective method of enhancing and even restoring device electrical properties.",9,
776,"We see that (Q1fk; fk) = (1=2)((k¼)2 ¡ i p ·=D), and (Q1fk; fj) = 0; k 6= j. Then, the assumptions of Theorem 2 are satis¯ed. Therefore, the system of eigenfunctions of the operator A is complete in the sense of Cauchy principal value since ffk = sin k¼yj k 2 ¤g is an orthogonal base in X. Similarly, we can check that the system of eigenfunctions of the operator B is complete in the sense of Cauchy principal value, where the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the operator P2Q2 are",-1,

778,"Structural, optical and electrical properties of Nb:STO films were found be dependent of deposition pressure. Decrease in deposition pressure leads to decrease in mean free path caused less number of collisions between ablated particles and gas species, which prevent gas phase nucleation and resulted in small grain size and enhanced packed density. Average transmittance in the visible region was found 91, 52 and 32% for sample S1, S2 and S3, respectively. The observed decrease in transmittance was due to the increased absorption and scattering as evidenced by increased extinction coefficient. Electrical resistivity was found to be decreased with decreasing oxygen partial pressure because of the generation of more carriers such as singly ionized vacancies and free electrons. Sample S1 and S2 demonstrated electro- and opto-resistive switching behaviors, while S3 did not exhibit any such behavior due to its conductive nature. Sample S1 exhibited almost 50.0 and 7.1% of difference in high and low resistance states on the application of current pulse and UV light, respectively. In addition, multi-level switching has been demonstrated successfully by the alternative use of current pulse and UV light. These application of Nb:STO can provide new dimensions to the device technologies.",16,
779,"In conclusion, we investigated organic resistive memory devices with interfacial oxide layers created using a simple O2 plasma treatment method. The interfacial oxide thickness increased with the plasma treatment time, which in turn changed the bistable resistance values. The devices subjected to additional plasma treatment exhibited higher ON/OFF ratios than devices with only native oxide, however, the threshold voltage distribution and switching reproducibility degraded in devices subjected to long plasma treatment times. Thus, the O2 plasma treatment conditions for the oxide formation should be carefully optimized by considering the essential memory parameters such as ON/OFF ratio, threshold voltage, and switching reproducibility.",48,
780,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the proper amount of the Ti addition to CoO improves the thermal stability. The unipolar resistance switching before and after the PDA process was confirmed in Pt/CoO/Ti 5 nm/Pt device, while the severe degradation of the initial resistance occurs in the Pt/CoO/Pt. Excess Ti shows oxygen gettering effect on CoO, resulting in the formation of metallic Co and quite low initial resistance of Pt/CoO/Ti 50 nm/Pt. The present result elucidates the mechanism of the degradation by the PDA process for the RRAM and the gives the solution in order to improve the thermal stability.",-1,
781,"In summary, the resistive switching characteristics of Au/ZnO/SS devices were studied to determine their suitability for flexible nonvolatile memory applications. The devices showed stable and reliable resistive switching behaviors over 100 switching cycles. Moreover, the resistive switching characteristics were not degraded upon bending of the device, and some of them were improved. The conduction mechanism of LRS and HRS are consistent with Ohmic conduction and PF emission, which is consistent with the filament theory. The results of this study indicate that SS can be an excellent substrate and is a promising candidate for use as electrodes in flexible ReRAM applications.",0,
782,"In summary, stress time in the pulse operation has strong influence on the uniformity and endurance of RRAM. An operation-oriented approach, i.e., width-adjusting pulse operation, has been proposed. Excellent control of RS parameters by this method has been demonstrated. The uniformity and endurance of oxide-based RRAM device can be significantly improved. The proposed method provides a valuable solution to promote the application of RRAM.",30,
783,"In conclusion, both traditional redox switching and oxygen-ion accumulation-induced switching behaviors can be observed in the devices. The latter is induced by introducing nitrogen, which is clarified by material analysis (FTIR), and the reliability of three resistive states (LRS/HRS/UHRS) is also be evaluated by retention and endurance tests. For contrast, traditional redox switching behavior is caused by the formation and rupture of the conduction path. The oxygen-ion
accumulation switching behavior is due to the following
mechanism: (1) the dislocated oxygen ions are accumulated in
the switching region near the TiN electrode and are extracted
from it by applying appropriate positive or negative voltage
and (2) as the dislocated oxygen ions (negative charge) are
captured by the lone-pair electrons of N and accumulated in
the switching region near the TiN electrode, it causes the
Schottky barrier height to increase. This oxygen-ion accumulation-induced switching behavior causes the sub-current
cycle which is responsible for the UHRS. Therefore, the redox
and migration of oxygen ions are the crucial factor for both
traditional redox switching and oxygen-ion accumulation
switching behaviors being observed in our device. This latter
sub-current cycle switching behavior suggests an extraordinary potential in RRAM applications because of its low operation power consumption.",10,
784,"In this study, we achieved the ferroelectric resistive switching up to about 850 in the PZT/NSTO heterostructure, which was prepared by chemical solution deposition with the 150 nm thick PZT films. The correlations between P−V and I−V curves, coercive field, and voltage of maximum ON/OFF ratio clearly demonstrated the modulation effect of ferroelectric polarization on resistive switching. We also explored the interfacial built-in field in the PZT/NSTO heterostructures based on the Schottky-Simmons model and the modified semiconductor theory. The magnitude and distribution of the electric field across the PZT/NSTO heterostructure were evaluated. Combined with the band structures of the PZT/ NSTO heterostructure, the variations of interfacial built-in electric field were clarified. The magnitude of the interfacial built-in field and the width of the depletion layer were modulated strongly by ferroelectric polarization, but the direction of the interfacial built-in field was unchanged in the PZT/NSTO heterostructure, which are all independent of the PZT thickness. The relative thickness that is strongly related to the ON/OFF ratio must be taken into consideration to modulate resistive switching behavior of ferroelectric−semiconductor heterostructures.",17,
785,"In summary, polycrystalline hexagonal yttrium manganite thin films sandwiched between an unpatterned Pt bottom electrode and a circular Al top electrode reveal unipolar resistive switching. In dependence on their chemical composition, yttrium manganite thin films show electroforming-based resistive switching with Y0.95Mn1.05O3 and Y1Mn0.99Ti0.01O3 compositions and electroforming-free resistive switching with Y1Mn1O3 (exception in the case of an applied positive bias) and Y0.94Mn1.05Ti0.01O3 compositions. Resistive switching is ascribed to the formation and rupture of conductive filaments. Yttrium manganite thin films have good retention properties. The OFF to ON resistance ratio is in the order of 104–105 and further increases with decreasing electrode size. The endurance of samples Y1Mn1O3 and Y0.95Mn1.05O3 with an applied negative bias is larger than 103 cycles. In HRS at low/high voltage ohmic/space charge, limited conduction dominates. As shown here for the cationic concentration, the electroforming-free resistive switching is fairly dependent on the composition of the yttrium manganite thin films. By controlling the cationic concentration, electroforming-free RS can be achieved in hexagonal yttrium manganite thin films. In future work, we will focus on controlling the cationic concentration in yttrium manganites for electroforming-free resistive switching.",27,
786,"In summary, this work unravels the exciton-mediated ultrafast free carrier relaxation in pure 2D perovskite thin films using transient THz spectroscopy. The existence of QWs in 2D perovskites facilitates the ultrafast relaxation of photoexcited free carriers via exciton formation, which aids in realizing the ultrafast THz photonic metadevice. The observed 20-ps switching time (~50-GHz modulation speed) is the fastest for a solution-processed integrated metadevice. Furthermore, the ease of integration of 2D perovskite thin film with the metamaterial fabricated on the flexible substrate opens up a new dimension in terms of applications, especially toward the realization of ultrafast flexible photonic devices. The proposed 2D perovskitebased hybrid metadevice could be an ideal platform to investigate the photon-phonon, photon-exciton, and electron-phonon coupling to explore the fundamental science and design of practical applicationbased devices. The integration of the 2D perovskite with metamaterials offers many advantages in terms of device stability, low cost, and
facile fabrication to push the THz applications toward large commercial scale, particularly where real-time control and manipulation of
THz radiation, such as short-range wireless THz communication,
ultrafast wavefront control, and photodetectors, is required._x000D_",12,
787,"In summary, AlN-based CRS devices were fabricated using magnetron sputtering with a variety of electrode materials. The deposited AlN film were confirmed to be hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure with (002) preferential orientation. Reliable and stable CRS characteristics were successfully demonstrated in both TiN/AlN/Cu/AlN/TiN electrochemical metallization cells and Pt/AlN/TiN/AlN/Pt ionic resistive switching systems. However, the Pt/AlN/Cu/AlN/Pt structure shows unstable resistive switching, which is attributed to the small Vreset (less than half of Vset) in the Cu/AlN/Pt element. Thermal effects enhanced reset process, which induced by the large reset current flow through the filaments, cause the relatively small Vreset. More optimizations of the device performance, e.g., increase the readout window and depress the dispersity of threshold voltage, are necessary for the practical applications of AlN-based crossbar memory arrays.",11,
788,"In summary, we have successfully fabricated an RRAM device with the hybrid material of GO in the polymer matrix of PVA. The surface morphology of materials, the hydrogen bonds between PVA and GO and the electrical properties of the Ag/PVAeGO/FTO sam- ples have been characterized using SEM and TEM techniques, FT-IR, Raman and UVevis spectroscopy, and IeV characteristics mea- surements. As a result, the Ag/PVAeGO/FTO with 0.5 wt% GO shows better performance with low operating voltages (sweeping and switching voltages < 0.5 V) and a high On/Off ratio (~10^4) compared to other veriﬁed structures in this work. The optical analysis showed the good interaction between GO and PVA through the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group (eOH) of PVA and C] O of GO, which might lead to low operating voltages. In addition, we have also proposed the resistive switching mechanism of the Ag/PVAe0.5 wt% GO/FTO device as due to trapping and de-trapping of electrons under the external electric ﬁeld. The signiﬁcant improvement of the resistive switching effect with low power consumption is beneﬁcial for the practical application of memory devices based on hybrid nanocomposite ﬁlms.",-1,
789,"In summary, resistive nonvolatile memory cells with a Ti/AZTO/Pt structure were fabricated at room temperature. The developed AZTO RRAM device exhibited bipolar switching behavior, remaining in a stable resistance state with exhibiting switching responses over 256 cycles, and a retention time of 104 s under a read disturb operation. The replacement of In and Ga-containing TAOS materials with AZTO film can effectively slow down the consumption of In and Ga elements, markedly reducing the cost of production of TAOS-based electrical devices. Moreover, the use of AZTO RRAMs in FPDs technology is potentially beneficial for the realization of SoP applications.",0,
790,"In summary, by comparison with STO based devices, we have shown that oxygen vacancy migration across BTO/NSTO interfaces greatly modifies the switching properties in a simple Pt/BTO/NSTO FTJ device. Stable three-state nonvolatile memory devices are realized by the combination of both fer- roelectricity and interface oxygen vacancy migration in Pt/BTO/ NSTO devices. The manipulation of both ferroelectricity and oxygen vacancies offers a new direction for high density and multistate memory device design.",7,
791,"Such an electrochemical replacement mechanism has not been previously discussed in the literature on RRAM. Yet, it contains generic features, so one may expect materials other than ZrTe to be suitable for making subquantum CBRAM cells. One alternative is TiTex, whose retention behavior was found to be governed by the same critical con- ductance found here for ZrTe. Not all binary Te alloys are suitable, however, an example being CuTex, which has been found to act as an electrochemical source of Cu,41–43 not Te (except perhaps at high voltage43). Filaments could also be engineered to contain alternate low-G1atom elements, such as those mentioned above, creating a rich opportunity to tailor the performance of subquantum CBRAM cells by materials engineering",11,
792,"In summary, the defect-induced RT-FM and bipolar RS behavior in the Pt/ZnO/Pt device was investigated. The resistance switching effect and ferromagnetic properties are intimately related to the native defects. The metal/dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS)/metal structure not only shows stable bipolar resistance switching characteristics, but also exhibits saturation magnetization and a strong endurance to withstand a large number of set/reset switching cycles. Especially, the bipolar resistive switching behavior and FM were obtained with good repeatability and uniformity. The results clearly demonstrate that the bias voltage is a determining factor that controls ferromagnetism switching in Pt/ZnO/Pt device for potential magneto-electrical device applications in the future.",-1,
793,"We demonstrate a new strategy to fabricate ionic conducting gadolinia-doped ceria/erbia multilayer dot array structures, illustrate the feasibility of side- ways dot contacting for 2 orders of magnitude smaller distances (15 μm) toward the state-of-the-art, and show that the ionic conductivity activation energy of the small conducting ceria-based phase can be manipulated by the compressively imposed strain activated volumes through the erbia for a multi- layer dot.",-1,
794,"All multilayer thin ﬁlm dots show the orientation aimed for; i.e., successful biaxial texturing of the metal oxide thin ﬁlms on the sapphire substrates can be concluded. To get insight into the interfacial state, Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the cation—anion-near order. Changes in the strain state can be correlated to a relative change of the positions of the Raman shifts and the sensitivity of this method allows observing increasing strain at the interface as the proportion of strained volume is increased. Regarding the activation energy, a change of Δ0.31 eV can be observed for ∼1.16% relative strain for the ceria-based phase in the multilayer samples.",68,
795,Our ﬁndings have the following implications for the future design of microelectrochemical devices based on strain oxide modulation.,54,
796,"First, a strategy to fabricate such electrochemical heterostructures as microdevices is presented. This strategy allows exploiting the altered ﬂux of charge carriers along the interfaces parallel to the surface for a sideways controlled ionic conducting multilayer dot. For example, our work opens the possibility to replace classic single metal oxide ﬁlms in future resistive switches by a functional strained multilayer dot. The broad range for which we can alter the ionic conductivity activation energy through compressive strain, in the given example of ceria single layers for the multi- layer dot, would not be achievable by classic doping or changes of nonstoichiometry for a resistive switch functional oxide ﬁlm. Hence, we can use the interfacial strain of such multilayer dots and short electrode distances to actively tune the desired resistive properties in their memristive and memcapacitive properties in follow-up studies. The short electrode distances were a prerequisite to reach typical local electric ﬁeld strengths of about >106 V/m.36 The presented fabrica- tion strategy together with the concept of microdots with strained internal interfaces is a promising avenue for novel electrochemical microdevices, e.g., energy conversion and storage devices, information technology devices, or sensors.",54,
797,"Second, we contribute with a hands-on proof-of- concept to the ongoing debate on the role of micro- electrode contacting for strained ionic conducting multilayers. Revealing that the classical top in-plane electrode approach is not suitable to measure real strain eﬀects for the given case of erbia/gadolinia-doped ceria multilayers, the change in activation energy is nil for a broad range of number of interfaces varied (ranging from a single layer thickness from 300 to 6) even though there is structural proof for strain. Mea- suring the same multilayer structures with the sideways contacted microdot approach reveals that a real strain effect is indeed measured. Defect thermodynamics and strain activated volume model were well applied to describe the change of conductivity and activation energy for the multilayers.",54,
798,"Third, to date it was challenging to compare strainionic transport results obtained by diﬀerent research groups for multilayer systems based on zirconia or ceria single layers as a conductive phase. Looking forward, the quantitative analysis of near order and ionic bond strength of the anionic-cationic lattice that can be measured by Raman punctuates its potential with respect to a multilayer's ﬁlm growth, processing, and chemistry. State-of-the-art literature considers cationic disorder to be characterized by XRD, and so very often no clear trends were observable relative to the varying strain activated volumes. However, we report that there are observable near order relaxation processes relative to the strain activated volume occurring on the near order and conﬁrm earlier computational study predictions.",68,
799,"In conclusion, oxygen-deficient atmosphere in the PLD process precipitated the formation of ferrimagnetic Fe3O4 thin films by using an a-Fe2O3 target. Stable and remarkable resistance switching with hysteresis has been observed in the Au/Fe3O4/Pt heterostructure. I-V tests with different pulse delays and R-T measurements with different source currents proved that an enhanced local Joule heating effect played a key role in the hysteresis in RS. And this candidate of mag- netic oxide for resistance switching provides a way to connect magnetic and electrical signals for memory cells. However, for Fe3O4, both the modulation of oxygen in the electrical and magnetic properties and the mechanism induc- ing the RS behavior need further investigation.",19,
800,"In conclusion, we investigated the origin of resistance switching in a Pt electrode and 0.5 wt. % Nb-doped STO by examining the microstructure and chemical states at the interface using STEM and EELS. A rectifying electrical behavior caused by the interface barrier was observed. In contrast to the typical explanation of low-resistance switching by accumulated high oxygen vacancies, we observed higher oxygen vacancies at the interface area, 3–4 nm wide, in the HRS. This relation was further verified by characterizing a similar system with more oxygen vacancies, i.e., Pt on H2-annealed Nb:STO. We propose that the defect energy levels within the band gap, determined by the oxygen vacancy concentration, were responsible for determining the barrier height.",10,
801,"In summary, here we have experimentally demonstrated an artificial neural network using memristors integrated into a dense, transistorfree crossbar circuit. This crossbar performed, on the physical (Ohm’s law) level, the analogue vector-by-matrix multiplication of equations (2) and (3), which is by far the most computationally intensive part of the operation of any neuromorphic network used repeatedly in the same environment. The other operations, described by equations (1), (4) and (5), were performed by external electronics, but they are much less critical for network performance, and in future, larger CrossNets may be (at least partly) assisted by CMOS subsystems. This is an important step towards the effective analogue-hardware implementation of much more complex neuromorphic networks, from multilayerperceptron classifiers with deep learning to elaborate CrossNet-based cognitive systems. Recent experiments with similar but smaller (discrete) devices imply that such circuits may be scaled down to devices of 30 nm across or less, that is, to networks with a density of approximately 10^10 synapses per square centimetre in each crossbar layer.",47,
802,"In summary, we have proposed a multipulse protocol that allows the study of resistive switching dynamics in a Ti– LPCMO interface upon sequential application of single polarity pulses. Based on the VEOV migration model,4 the scaling dependence DR / NpexpðIpcÞ is demonstrated. This simple physical relationship reveals that, to achieve a given high resistance target state (a higher HR/LR ratio), it is more efficient to increase the pulse amplitude rather than to accumulate pulses of a given amplitude. The agreement of overall experimental data with simulations validates the proposed model assumptions and its associated equations. Thus, an unbalanced number of SET/RESET pulses is demonstrated to be a plausible strategy to optimize the actual response of a device.",5,
803,"We must point out here, that preliminary results have been reported on Na0.79CoO2 single crystals, where its surface can be conveniently modified by conducting-probe- mediated reversible electrochemical sodium intercalation/ deintercalation reactions. This process yields more conducting (or more insulating) patterns, with reversible erasing. Although this work and our work both deal with the manipulation of Na interstitials in between the CoO2 layers, there are obvious differences. In our reported data, we believe that we just reposition the Na interstitials among the different almost degenerate configurations macroscopically in the sample, while Schneegans et al. take off or add by electrochemical means the interstitials in particular regions of the sample and their process falls into the third type of mechanisms as described in Ref 1.",72,
804,"In summary, we developed an interface-modified RCB network model that can explain the reversible changes of RS-type between BRS and URS. This model provides a viable alternative pathway to understanding both the BRS and URS in terms of the collective behavior of switching elements under external bias. ",5,
805,"In summary, anisotropic ferromagnetism of Ni conducting filaments formed in a NiO thin film was demonstrated. The NiO RRAM capacitor exhibited a typical bistable resistive switching characteristic. The magnetizations of the ROFF and RON states were measured as a function of the applied magnetic field. For the ROFF state, the NiO thin film showed an antiferromagnetic hysteresis loop. However, for the RON state, the conducting filaments exhibited a ferromagnetic hysteresis loop. The ferromagnetic hysteresis loop of the RON state for the FC showed switchable exchange coupling between the ferromagnetic Ni conducting filaments and the antiferromagnetic NiO layer.",16,
806,"We demonstrated the role of the TE oxide AlOx layer and the distinct resistive switching properties in active AlTE-based PCMO junctions. In contrast to the inert Ag or Pt TE-based junctions, the Al-based junctions have unique features, i.e., large junction resistance, opposite cycling directions, asymmetric switching thresholds, long switching time, and unstable LRS. All of the features in Al/PCMO/Pt junctions are interpreted by the formation and dissociation of the alumina layer at the interface between Al and PCMO, instead of the previously proposed conducting filaments in Ag or Pt based junctions. The results would provide additional information to help understanding the intrinsic nature of the resistive switching effect in the MIM structures.",25,
807,"In summary, high-speed (∼50 ns) and high energy-eﬃciency (∼7.3 fJ) MoS2-based multiterminal synaptic device is realized, exhibiting excellent nonvolatile multilevel resistive switching modulated by both Vds and Vg, allowing it to be used to emulate homosynaptic and heterosynaptic plasticity. A tunable analogue weight update (on/oﬀ ratio and update nonlinearity) of the synapse has been emulated in such devices. The eﬀect of the on/oﬀ ratio and weight update nonlinearity on the pattern recognition accuracy has also been simulated by using the MNIST dataset. These results demonstrate that the artiﬁcial synapse based on van der Waals heterostructures with tunable synaptic functions holds great potential for future neuro- morphic computing.",74,
808,"We have demonstrated the capability of grafting autonomous electronic circuits capable of logic operation and information storage on submillimetre-sized particles, forming CSMs. Our particles can undergo aerosolization while carrying functional electronics on-board capable of interaction with the environment. With a thickness of 1.24µm and weight of ~1.4 gm−2 , this CSM design represents one of the thinnest and lightest circuits produced so far. In this design, the on-board circuit forms a state machine with two inputs (chemical and optical) and one output composed of a memristor. Due to the use of 2D materials, CSM requires only 30nW to irreversibly record events, granting it the ability to be powered from the energy harvested by the on-board 2D photodiode (30–100nW). The results of chemical sensing are irreversibly stored in the memory (inducing memristor conductivity changes of up to 150 times). Furthermore, the addition of integrated retroreflectors allows the dispersed CSMs to be rapidly (<1ms per frame) detected by a laserscanning system. CSMs may find application in a wide range of areas, including biosensing (for example, within the human digestive tract), large-area sensing, confined space monitoring (for example, chemical and biosynthetic reactors, oil and gas conduits) and aerospace programmes.",53,
809,"In summary, superior resistive switching performance of an Au/Ti/TiO2_x0002_x/Au ﬁlm stack was demonstrated, in terms of switching ratio, switching dynamics, cycling endurance, and charge retention capability. The ﬁlm was produced with a room temperature based fabrication process and does not require an initial electroforming procedure prior to operation. The reduced state of the deposited ﬁlm was conﬁrmed by XRD and electrical measurements. Electrochemical migration of oxygen ions is employed in order to interpret the switching phenomenon. As a result, formation and annihilation of conducting ﬁlaments, which consist of electrons and oxygen vacancies, near the interface of Ti/TiO_(2-x) ﬁlm is regarded to be responsible for the change of the samples resistance state. Ti top electrode plays a major role, acting as oxygen reservoir for the extracted from the dielectric matrix oxygen ions. This reservoir provides sufﬁcient oxygen ions for the reoxidization of the conducting ﬁlaments, leading the device to the HRS. The conductivity of the LRS is governed by Ohm’s law, while the high density of traps inside the dielectric matrix inhibits the full manifestation of P-F emission. Also, the presence of many traps inhibits the steep transition of the measured current, permitting only the gradual increase. Calculation of the ﬁlaments diameter revealed their nm scale, indicating promising potential for aggressive device scaling.",34,
810,"In summary, we fabricated W 18 O 49 /Au core-shell nanowire arrays and characterized their RS behavior. Each nanowire string had an MIM structure and functioned as an RS device. The nanowire array devices showed stable bipolar RS characteristics. The switching was based on SBH changes that were induced by redox reactions at the interface between the W 18 O 49 and W electrode. Evidence of the redox reactions was investigated using HR-TEM and showed a roughening of the W 18 O 49 /W interface after a number of switching operations. Moreover, because the device was structured using nanowires, the surface of the device exhibited superhydrophobic characteristics after chemical surface modifi cations. When water was poured over the device surface, it was repelled from the device, and the device was protected from failure by water contact. Surprisingly, the superhydrophobicity was maintained even under water, and a total refl ection was observed on the device surface. This indicates that the devices were free from the failure by water contact even in submerged conditions, and the devices showed stable RS characteristics even after submergence under water for one week. This report presents the RS phenomena and its mechanism as studied for tungsten oxide nanowires and presents the concept of new waterproof electronic devices that can function under water without any other treatments.",1,
811,"In conclusion, the threshold current density at the resistance transition of the Pt nanogap electrode is about twice that of the Au one. The material dependence can be explained on the basis of the activation energy of Pt and Au nanowires for electromigration, which indicates that the origin of the resistance transition from low- to high-resistance state in the nanogap is the similar as that of electromigration.",1,
812,"In summary, the tunneling electroresistance of Pt/BTO/SRO FTJs has been investigated as a function of temperature. The existence of two distinct resistance states upon polarization reversal is clearly observed. Typical bipolar resistance switching with an ON/OFF ratio of ~10 is achieved at room temperature. As temperature decreases, the currents through the Pt/BTO/SRO FTJs decrease by over about two orders of magnitude from 290 to 50 K. The indirect tunneling conduction, resulting from the phonon-assisted electron hopping through defect chains in the BTO barrier, is found to be responsible for the significantly temperature-dependent I-V characteristics of Pt/BTO/SRO. Direct tunneling conduction is observed below 50 K when defect-mediated tunneling currents are substantially suppressed. The ON/OFF ratio increases correspondingly by a factor of 3 with decreasing temperature. These results suggest that the reduction of defect density and then the suppression of indirect tunneling can greatly enhance the performance of FTJs and thus is a prerequisite for their future applications in non-destructive readout nonvolatile resistive ferroelectric memories.",17,
813,"In summary, we fabricated the NiO-based memristor by solution combustion method with a simple process and low cost. Multiple features including analog bipolar resistive switching and digital bipolar resistive switching were obtained simultaneously in this NiO-based memristor. Prior to the electroforming, the device presents an analog resistive switching. On the basis of the analog resistive switching, several synaptic functions such as nonlinear transmission characteristics, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, LTM/STM, and “learning-experience” behavior were demonstrated. Schottky barrier change at the interface of Ag/p-NiO was used to explain the analog resistive switching mechanism, which is caused by local migration of oxygen ion under an electric field. After the electrical-forming operation, the digital bipolar resistive switching was observed. It can be explained based on the formation and rupture of the oxygen vacancies conducting path. This NiO memristor integrated with analog/ digital resistive switching in a single cell will provide a new device to development analog and digital memory hybrid system.",-1,
814,"We investigated the change in the properties of bulk CoO resulting from oxygen vacancies and charge carrier trapping around the oxygen vacancies. We found that oxygen vacancies and charge carrier trapping cause the transition from insulating to metallic. Then, we performed calculations for slab models of CoO in contact with Ta, W, and Pt electrodes, and hence evaluated the effects of oxygen vacancies at the interface between the CoO layer and the electrode layer.",10,
815,"On the basis on these results, we explored the desirable electrode material for RRAM devices by targeting the change in resistance from insulating to metallic induced by applying a low voltage. We found that W is suitable compared with Ta and Pt.",30,
816,The method proposed in this paper can be applicable to the design of RRAM devices consisting of other oxides and electrode materials. We find it necessary to understand the switching and nonvolatile mechanism of RRAM through more indepth investigations and hope that this method serves as a useful tool for the development of RRAM technology.,30,
817,"In conclusion, the cross-point circuit has been shown to provide a one-step solution to linear regression and logistic regression, which is demonstrated in experiments with RRAM devices. The one-step learning capability relies on the high parallelism of analog computing by physical Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s law within the circuit and physical iteration within the nested feedback architecture. The scalability of the cross-point computing is demonstrated with large problems, such as the Boston housing dataset and the MNIST dataset. The results evidence that in-memory computing is remarkably promising for accelerating ML tasks with high latency/energy performance in a wide range of data-intensive applications.",59,
818,"The high-temperature retention characteristics of the DL device is also studied for device performance with the read voltage of 0.3 V, at 130 °C as shown in Fig. 7. The DL device can well maintain both LRS=HRS for more than 105s. Therefore, these results suggest that the DL device with the 1 nm Al2O3 film has a high potential for nonvolatile memory applications owing to its high endurance and large retention characteristics compared with those of the SL and 3 and 5 nm Al2O3 DL devices.",5,
819,"The highly stable reliability properties including endurance and retention of the Ta5Si3-based device with an insertion of Al2O3 layer (DL device) were studied. During reset, the higher thermal conductivity of Al2O3 than that of Ta5Si3 pushes the maximum temperature point away from the bottom electrode. Thus, the filament rupture in DL device takes place near the center of the device, leading to low operation voltages, sharp distributions of LRS and HRS, and highly stable endurance (>104) in the DL device. The DL device also shows excellent retention property up to 105 s at 130°C. The conduction mechanism to achieve the uniform and highly stable reliability behaviors in the DL device was also proposed.",62,
820,"In conclusion, titanium dioxide thin films were prepared by ALD on Pt electrodes and the electrical properties were analyzed by CAFM measurements. From the results we conclude that probably two mechanisms are involved in resistance switching if copper is incorporated. A minor part is caused by the inherent conduction due to oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 film. The majority is attributed to the diffusion of copper and the formation of conductive filaments. This is proved by CAFM measurements, which reveal bipolar resistive switching with a HRS/LRS ratio of about 30.",34,
821,"In summary, we induce controlled number of conducting filaments using conductive AFM on NiO films before conventional two-probe electrical measurement. Initial resistance state and following unipolar resistive switching characteristics are strongly dependent on the number of preformed conducting filaments. Especially, set voltage distribution increases with the number of preformed conducting filaments. These experimental results provide the way to control set voltage distribution in unipolar resistive switching materials.",16,
822,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated the resistance switching in a nanogap junction using voltage pulses in both directions. The ON state switching is executed by introducing a series resistance to the nanogap junction. The parasitic capacitance of the contact pad and cables limit the highspeed switching. This was overcome by reducing the pad capacitance and changing the measurement configuration. The junction is capable of switching its resistance at ns pulse widths in either direction. When the device element is further scaled down to nm structures, the ON state speed can be enhanced further, suggesting the potentiality for high-density high-speed non-volatile memory applications.",0,
823,"Exploiting laser–material interactions in inorganic flexible elec- tronics provides performance enhancements in next-generation electronics, displays, and energy devices. Here, we have dis- cussed recent advances and developments in the field of heating (sintering and annealing), reaction (synthesis and doping), and delamination (patterning and laser lift-off) using laser–material interactions. First, a laser-assisted sintering process will pro- vide an important tool for transparent electrodes of metal NWs in next-generation flexible optoelectronics such as displays and biomedical applications. In addition, laser-induced synthesis of ultrathin nanomaterials and hydrothermal growth of NWs may open up a key role in the development for flexible applications. Finally, these approaches employing laser–material interaction and processing such as laser annealing and ILLO will be increas- ingly important and may lead to an efficient process platform that resolves temperature issues. This will benefit industrial implementation of high-performance inorganic-based flexible devices.",12,
824,"In conclusion, the resistive switching behavior of PCMO thin films deposited on an LNO-electrodized Si substrate was examined. Highly _x0001_100-textured PCMO thin films on LNO have asymmetric I-V relations with hysteresis loops, resulting in resistance memory effect with LRS and HRS during the forward and backward sweeping of the voltage, respectively. The resistive switching behavior of the PCMO capacitors on LNO is related to the trap-controlled SCLC mechanism, and the LNO/PCMO/LNO capacitor exhibits the strongest resistive switching effect with a resistance ratio for about two orders of magnitude.",14,
825,"In this work, we investigated the impact of the top electrode material on the characteristics of the WOX ReRAM. A high WF TE forms a Schottky barrier with WOX, resulting in lower forming/switching current and larger resistance ratio window. Based on these findings, a novel Ni TE WOX ReRAM was proposed, and the new device showed superior performance than that from the conventional TiN TE WOX ReRAM devices.",1,
826,"The CMOS-compatible 3D crossbar array-applicable Ni/SiNx/AlOy/TiN memristor stack exhibits gradual set and reset switching characteristics, which are highly appropriate for synapse devices in neuromorphic applications. We firstly determined smooth and continuous gradual reset switching regions, and investigate the conduction mechanisms in order to demonstrate biological synaptic behavior. We observed symmetric and linear conductance modulation for LTP and LTD by adjusting the pulse amplitude. Furthermore, we demonstrated STDP, which is one of the important learning rules in biological synapses, by designing timing differences between pre- and post-synaptic spikes.",3,
827,"In conclusion, current-induced phase transition was successfully demonstrated in high-quality epitaxial thin films of CRO grown by the SPE method. An abrupt resistive transition with a hysteretic behavior was observed in the R–T characteristics measured under constant-voltage conditions. The current-induced transition in the thin films exhibited very small variations in the switching fields and currents during cycling. High controllability of the resistance values and transition behaviors was also observed depending on the amplitudes of applied currents and voltages. These results also raised some questions concerning the mechanisms of the currentinduced transition, such as the influences of the epitaxial strain and current densities. Although much higher current densities (~0.1 MA cm−1) will be applied to the CRO thin films than those to bulk CRO (~1 A cm−1),qualitatively similar behaviors were observed between the transitions. To answer these questions, further measurements under controlled current densities via micropatterning for the CRO thin films should be conducted. The findings in this study will open new areas for controlling strongly correlated electronic phases based on current applications, and future developments of Mott-electronic devices with high controllability of the resistance state.",4,
828,"In summary, the Ti/BTO/SRO and Pt/BTO/SRO capacitors were fabricated by PLD, and their dielectric, ferroelectric, RS, and PVE properties were studied comparatively. The C-f results suggest that the Ti/BTO interface is Ohmic while an interfacial layer forms between the Pt and BTO. This interfacial layer, in which the opening/closing of conduction paths may occur, seems to be the origin of RS observed in the Pt/BTO/SRO capacitor. However, in the Ti/BTO/SRO capacitor without the interfacial layer effect, negligible RS is observed and the dominant conduction mechanism is identified as PFE. On the other hand, the combined results of C-V, P-V, and PFM show the selfpolarization and imprint phenomena, revealing the existence of Ein in the BTO films. This Ein may be responsible for the charge separation in the PVEs in both the Ti/BTO/SRO and Pt/BTO/SRO capacitors. As a result, the V_OCs of the two capacitors are similar in magnitude and they are electrically unswitchable. Our study therefore suggests that in certain ferroelectric capacitors, the interfacial layer and the internal bias field can cause the RS and PVE, respectively, whereas the polarization may play a minor role.",4,
829,"In summary, we prepared NiO thin films on a Pt/TiO2 /SiO2 / Si substrate by a rf sputtering method. The Hg/NiO/ Pt capacitor with the Hg top electrode diameter of about 35 μm showed the typical resistive switching property as the R_off and R_on states. We directly observed the formation and removal of filaments at the R_off and R_on states by CAFM measurements. The R_off state showed leakage current regions which are almost located at the grain boundaries. For the R_on state, point current images in the CAFM image indicate discrete formations of filaments which are formed at the grain boundary regions as well as the nongrain boundary regions. We suggest that these CAFM observations of NiO thin film give the direct evidence for the filament model in RRAM.",29,
830,"In conclusion, we have investigated the significant role of top interface layer formed at the region between the top Al electrode and PEDOT:PSS organic layer on the stable bipolar resistive switching behaviors in Al/PEDOT:PSS/Al memory devices, comparing with devices of Au top electrode. From I-V characterizations of both devices, current conduction of Al/PEDOT/Al devices was well dominated by trap-controlled SCLC model, while Au case showed an electrical breakdown. HRTEM and in-situ XPS analyses clearly demonstrated the amorphous top interface layer of the Al top electrode device consisted of Al, O, and S elements and played a crucial role in trapping and detrapping process of electrons.",11,
831,"In summary, we present a fully inkjet printed resistive memory device on a ﬂexible substrate without need for additional process steps. The Ag/SOG/polymer cells on PEN foils show a promising switching behavior with a low power consumption. The high ratio between the OFF- and ON-resistance gives rise to multi bit data storage, where the size and conductance of the metallic ﬁlament is controllable by the external current compliance. Combined with printable select transistors the cells could be used for active memory crossbar arrays. Passive arrays could be achieved by printing a ﬁve layer structure and using a complementary resistive switching approach. Progress in printing will directly translate into enhanced performance of these memory devices.",48,
832,"In summary, we report a resistive switching and a threshold switching effect upon the application of an electrical field. Both behaviors are a bulk effect rather than interface effect. The Co2þ ions dopant gives rise to high concentration of oxygen vacancies. As a result, the distribution of mobile charges is locally unbalanced upon application of electrical fields, which was thought as the reason for the observed resistive switching and asymmetric J-E curves.",-1,
833,"To summarize, we numerically model two physical reservoir computing systems based on theMSMand STNOs for temporal information processing. We find that the RC system with only one MSM can achieve a comparable accuracy 87.6% of pattern recognition as the physical reservoir with 88 metal-oxide memristors. Additionally, both the second-order nonlinear problem and NARMA10 tasks show that the STNO-based RC system also has good performance in solving unknown and complex nonlinear dynamic problems. Our results demonstrate that spin-torque nanodevices with low-energy consumption and high-speed information processing capabilities are very suitable to construct an artificial neural network for neuromorphic computing and further also provide the strategies for experimentally building the better physical reservoir for machine learning based computing.",39,
834,"In conclusion, we have shown that potentiostatically anodized aluminum oxide is potentially interesting for the roomtemperature fabrication of organic flash memories on rigid and flexible substrates with low, tunable program and erase voltages of -5 V and 5 V, respectively, and a large charge retention time exceeding 10^5 s with only minor degradation of the memory window. Such memories may be useful in flexible electronic devices, which include circuits, sensors, and information storage components.",22,
835,"In summary, we studied the analog RS behavior of tantalum-oxide-based memristors and showed that by selectively controlling different internal state variables the analog dynamic range can be significantly improved. The analog characteristics can be separated into two regions that are dominated by Vo drift and diffusion processes, respectively. By adding a heating pulse to conventional SET pulses, we can selectively enhance the diffusion process during the filament expansion stage and consequently extend its analog dynamic range and achieve a more desired analog RS curve shape. Combined with continued material and device optimizations,14 these advances will help enable continued device development for memristor-based applications such as neuromorphic systems.",8,
836,"In summary, a PCM cell was fabricated by stacking 100 nm thick GST and 8 nm thick TiO2 thin films. The initial cell had robust insulating properties due to the insulating pristine TiO2 dielectric layer. The electroforming step formed conducting filaments in the TiO2 layer, which offered a current flow path for the amorphization and recrystallization of GST. The amorphization and recrystallization of the GST were responsible for the memory operation of the device for a given filamentary condition in the TiO2. The larger number of filaments in TiO2 was accompanied by a larger heat loss to the metal contact, resulting in a lower RHRS. Four different memory states were achieved by controlling the number of filaments in the TiO2 layer by adjusting the maximum current flow. The reset of the filaments in the TiO2 could be accomplished stably by a bipolar type voltage stress.",24,
837,"In summary, ionization effects of Cs137 γ-ray radiation on the Ta/Ta2O5-x/Al2O3/InGaZnO4 memristor devices have been investigated. This memristor device demonstrates a good radiation-harden capability and high-temperature tolerance in resistive switching. In subsequent pulse cycling or DC sweep operations, the device resistance decreases because more carriers are generated in the dielectric layer after Cs137 γ-ray radiation. Besides, I-V characteristics at different temperatures before and after radiation were fitted and compared. The XPS shows the increase in the oxygen vacancy after irradiation. The HRS and LRS conductions are in good agreement with the hopping conduction mechanism. A smaller hopping distance and a lower trap energy level confirm that the carrier hopping becomes easier, and hence, a large current is obtained. The higher stability and performance uniformity of this Ta/Ta2O5-x/Al2O3/InGaZnO4 memristor device show great potential for electronic artificial synapse in harsh electronics.",42,
838,"In this work, 2DOMDs, 2DMDs, and OMDs were all successfully fabricated herein with a simple process. The 2DOMDs exhibited lower VS and VR threshold voltages, more concentrated threshold voltage distribution, faster switching speed, longer retention time, and higher endurance than the OMDs and 2DMDs. Moreover, comprehensive biosynaptic functions and plasticity were observed. In possessing positive/ negative bidirectional pulse sequence properties, the 2DOMDbased device model can achieve 87% learning accuracy. These results showed that by incorporating WS2 nanosheets with zirconia as double-layer MDs, the performance of the device is significantly enhanced over that of 2DMDs and OMDs. This may be because of the different transport rates of Ag ions in the 2D material layer and the oxide layer, thereby limiting the rupture/rejuvenation of the CFs at the bilayer interface. The Ag filaments nucleation/growth areas of the 2DOMDs were shortened and relatively fixed, which greatly reduced the randomness of the CFs in MDs. This research opens up new avenues for optimizing the performance of memory devices to facilitate the further development of artificial synapses for brain-enhanced computing systems.",3,

840,"We have provided a survey on the recent progress on the growth of high-quality 1D and 2D electrically and/or optically active supramolecular nanostructures and their integration in working devices by means of unconventional nanofabrication techniques. Toward this end, we have described the most enlightening protocols to achieve controlled molecular self-assembly forming 1D and 2D organic semiconducting materials. Compared with the growth of macroscopic organic crystals which requires strict environmental condition and significant time, the growth of supramolecular nanostructures is much faster and easier. In particular, crystalline 1D self-assembled nanostructures could easily obtain by solventinduced-precipitation and phase transfer method. Different antisolvents could effectively modulate nanostructure stiffness from flexible nanowire to rigid microwire. In 1D semiconducting nanowires, the strong π–π intermolecular interactions dominate growth orientation and facilitate charge transport along the long axis of the nanowire, which makes 1D semiconducting nanowires promising platform for OFET, sensing and photovoltaic devices. Compared with the well-known 1D nanostructures, the fabrication of newly emerged self-assembled 2D molecular layers have been a long-term challenge. We summarized three approaches for achieving large area, high-quality 2D organic molecular crystals, including spontaneous self-assembly, molecular epitaxy and external force induced self-assembly. Interestingly, solution processing of small organic molecules enabled the formation of 2D crystalline film combining high structural order, large lateral size and mono- or a few-layers thickness. The 2D monolayer structure can greatly reduce the net contact resistance and facilitate carrier injection, and an excellent field-effect mobility of 10cm^2 V^(-1)s^(-1) has been demonstrated. In addition, charge transport in such thin molecular layer can be easily influenced by external stimuli, being a characteristic extremely appealing for sensing applications.",60,
841,"Despite being highly challenging, the use of nanofabrication approaches toward the connection of discrete self-assembled nanostructures to electrodes for high-performance supramolecular (opto)electronic devices is a crucial step with the longterm goal being high integration organic circuits. We outlined five unconventional strategies for nanofabrication devices based on supramolecular organic nanocrystals with bottom- or top-contact configurations, including shadow mask, stamping technique, nanoimprint lithography, colloidal lithography, and direct photolithography. By using these processing and fabrication strategies, the soft materials can be readily integrated into multifunctional electronic devices such as field-effect transistors and organic solar cells. ",60,
842,"Supramolecular electronics aims at taking advantage of selfassembly strategies to construct moldable organic nanostructures and to integrate them in miniaturized electronic devices. The use of artificial supramolecular assemblies like nanowires for photovoltaic applications allows to study fundamental physical and chemical properties of nanostructured materials by understanding the structure versus function relationship, and it also holds a clear technological relevance. We highlighted concrete solutions to two critical issues for the integration of supramolecular nanostructures into macroscopic devices: i) addressing multiple discrete supramolecular structures into electrodes simultaneously; ii) designing “macroscopic nanoelectrodes” to connect as many supramolecular structures at the same time to collect the signals better. Two types of device configuration were suggested that can adequately address these two issues: nanomesh scaffold and sub-micrometer electrodic cavity. The nanomesh scaffold featuring asymmetric (nano)electrodes and sub-micrometer vertical-channel were exploited for photovoltaic cell and ultrafast photodetector with nanosecond refresh rate. The organic crystals in photovoltaic devices also help to understand how the molecular and supramolecular structure affect photoelectrical conversion in organic π-system. ",60,
843,"This report shall spark the curiosity and creativity of chemists, physicists, materials scientists, and engineers working on nanostructured organic semiconductors to design new optoelectronic devices based on discrete materials rather than uniform film. The sub-micrometer electrodic cavity enables device working under the wet condition and makes it possible the insitu characterization of the optoelectronic property of nondry materials like supramolecular π-gels. The combination of simple fabrication, the flexibility of organic materials, and the unique physical properties of the self-assembly supramolecular nanostructures offer unlimited opportunities for application in next-generation electronics. The time may have come for supramolecular electronics to bridge the gap between proofs of principle and applications. ",60,
844,"In summary, we fulfill the large number of requirements for efficient neuromorphic computing in a single organic ECRAM device: linear resistance tuning with a >2× dynamic range, fast switching (20 ns), submicrosecond write-read cycling, low-voltage (±1 V) and low-energy (~80 fJ per write) operation, low noise (ΔG^2/σ^2 > 100), and excellent endurance both at room temperature and at elevated temperature (>10^9 write-read operations at 90°C). Our materials selection strategy proves to be quite general, as it can be effectively implemented using various ionic liquids and other block copolymers (fig. S7). In contrast, it has been proven difficult to optimize PCMs and ReRAMs across all metrics, such as attaining both low write noise and low current operation, which are needed for scaling to large arrays.",51,
845,"While this work represents a fundamental step toward designing organic ECRAMs to be compatible with fabrication into high-density synaptic arrays, some important challenges remain due to the strict temperature and contamination requirements for integration with CMOS. Alternative fabrication pathways exist for integrating emerging nonvolatile memories with CMOS, such as low-temperature monolithic 3D integration of carbon nanotubes and ReRAMs (29), and remain an active area of pursuit to improve such compatibility.",51,
846,"Last, we emphasize that the ECRAM concept is not limited to organic materials. The lessons learned here, such as the importance of mobile species infiltrating the channel before electrochemical gating and possibly relying on proton conduction for fast switching, can also benefit ECRAMs made with other ion intercalation materials such as 2D materials, van der Waals heterostructures, or MXene composites.",51,
847,"In summary, we have investigated the resistance switching and NDR characteristics of ferroelectric devices. The resistance switching and NDR behaviors are closely related to the Schottky junction at Au/BTO interface. The NDR behavior can be achieved in the Au/BTO/FTO devices by controlling the positive applying bias. The interface states trapping/detrapping electrons are proposed to understand the NDR and resistance switching behaviors.",17,
848,"In summary, we have studied the temperature dependence of spin injection from ferromagnetic contacts into car- bon nanotubes. The resistance switching is observed to change sign as a function of increasing temperature, indicating the existence of a nonferromagnetic interfacial layer that modifies the polarization of the injected spin. This implies that to observe larger and more reproducible spin mediated effects in carbon nanotube devices, improvements in the purity of the ferromagnetic interface layer are required.",40,
849,"In summary, we propose a simple model of local switching induced by charge carrier fluence to explain the timedependent switching behavior in NiO capacitors. A Monte Carlo simulation of the model simulated the random nature of the electroforming process and visualized the switching propagation of electroforming and current surges for switching events. The simulation results fit qualitatively to the experimental data obtained by TDDB measurements.",65,
850,"In summary, the RRAM prototype devices that have been built using p-type amorphous CuAlOx films, display good performance in metrics that include high on/off ratio, long retention time, fast switching speed, and excellent mechanical flexibility. The RS parameters and electrical properties of CFs are observed to depend strongly on the background oxygen concentration. These dependences are in contrast with the prevailing oxygen-vacancy based model in n-type oxides, indicating that the CFs in the CuAlOx switching layer have p-type conduction and consist of Cu-vacancy acceptors. The present work, targeting the understanding of the RS mechanism and CFs’ nature of p-type CuAlOx, is helpful for developing new RRAMs based on p-type oxides or p-n junctions and also demonstrates the possibility of modulating RS performance by changing the material composition.",11,
851,"We report a unidirectional bipolar resistive switching in an n-type GaOx/p-type NiOx heterojunction fabricated by magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The resistive switching behavior coincides with the switching between Ohmic conduction (low resistance) and rectifying behavior (high resistance) of the heterojunction diode. Under external electric field, electromigrated intrinsic defects, such as oxygen vacancies and oxygen ions, accumulate at the pn junction interface and modify the interface barrier, forming or rupturing the filamentary paths between n-GaOx and p-NiOx, leading to the switching between Ohmic and diode characteristics of the device. The device shows good endurance, retention performance, and scaling capability, signaling the potential of a diode-structured resistive switching device for non-volatile memory applications.",20,
852,"In conclusion, a unidirectional bipolar RS was observed in the GaOx-NiOx heterostructure fabricated by magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The RS behavior could be concluded as the switching between rectifying and Ohmic behavior of the diode. The alteration of junction barrier due to the electric field and the migration of intrinsic defects (oxygen vacancies in GaOx and oxygen ions in NiOx) control the filamentary paths passing through the interface, which accounts for the RS behavior observed. The device shows good endurance and retention performance, manifesting the potential application of p-n junction structure in non-volatile memory.",20,
853,"The formation of copper oxide ﬁlm under RTSP oxidation (i.e., the change in thickness and composition of the oxide over time) on two polycrystalline copper ﬁlms with diﬀerent crystallinity and surface morphology was studied using reﬂectometry and ellipsometry (RE) measurements ﬁtted with an EMA model. The thickness followed an inverse logarithmic growth rate, showing good agreement with what was suggested by Cabrera and Mott,34 and conﬁrmed by diﬀerent studies.2,4,18,25 The cupric (Cu2O) and cuprous (CuO) oxide volume fraction on the resulting copper oxides was obtained using only RE measurements ﬁtted with an EMA model. XPS was used to validate the analysis solely based on RE. These suggest that RE measurements ﬁtted with an EMA model is a reliable method to obtain details of the progress in oxidation of copper (i.e., thickness, growth rate and composition). Combined with AFM and XRD, the RE measurements revealed that the crystalline characteristics and surface morphology of as-deposited copper ﬁlms primarily determine the thickness and composition of the resulting copper oxide ﬁlms. Explicit control on the initial characteristics of as-deposited copper ﬁlms would allow us to actively design the oxidation to obtain a desired copper oxide ﬁlm in terms of its thickness and RCuO ratio required for a speciﬁc device.",62,
854,"In conclusion, we have presented a current transient method to investigate the trap characteristics in ferroelectric BFO thin films. The method consists of measuring the detrapping transient and extracting the time constant from the current transient curve. The detrapping process was found to be thermally activated with an activation energy of 0.71 6 0.06 eV. The detrapping time constant showed a dependence on the trapping voltage and trapping pulse duration, which can be explained via the relationship between the escape frequency of the charge carriers and the structure ordering caused by polarization and the filling of traps. Our method can be incorporated in electrical reliability experiments (e.g., fatigue testing). The time constant from even a single-temperature measurement can provide useful information on trap behavior, such as the trap filling status and the structure ordering. It is expected that this technique will be used to help to understand the evolution of traps which occurs as a result of electrical degradation in RRAM. Finally, we would like to point out that the results described in this work are not limited to BiFeO3 thin films but can be applied to other materials with RS effects involving the trapping of charge carriers.",4,
855,"In conclusion, current sweep measurements on SiOx RRAM devices show very different set behaviors as com- pared to voltage sweep measurements, where multiple resist- ance steps were clearly identified by the current sweep. This phenomenon is in agreement with a previous compliance current study and suggests that current sweeps provide a more precise characterization of the set process. By investi- gating the set behavior of different devices, it was found that the number of resistance steps can change dramatically from device to device. This variation was attributed to the random nature of percolation pathway during electroforming. Finally, our results show how a continuous defect distribu- tion has the potential advantage of achieving multi-bit mem- ory storage and described possible methods for optimizing the defect distribution using hydrogen-based anneals.",6,
856,"In summary, the fabrication of pentacene memory device using SiNWs has been demonstrated. The pentacene/ SiNWs memory is stable and rewritable with ON/OFF ratio up to 120. Memory mechanisms are described on the basis of the I–V results. The fitting data of the I–V curves demonstrated that the carrier transport mechanism related to the memory effect of the Au/pentacene/SiNWs/nþ-Si device was attributed to the PF emission, while the corresponding mechanism of the Au/pentacene/H2O2-treated SiNWs/nþ-Si device was related to the thermionic emission-diffusion process. This approach of using SiNWs as nanotraps, by virtue of its simplicity in design and processing, can realize integrated memory devices and circuits in low-cost plastic electronics applications.",22,

Therefore, particularly with the rise of nonvolatile and analog technologies, CAMs rep- resent a new in-memory compute circuit primitive that merits deeper investigation to its possible applications driven by rising modern pattern matching and data processing workloads today.",47,
858,"Here, we have comprehensively surveyed the research on GDYs. This section presents future prospects for GDYs, as well as a summary of the previous sections. GDYs have attracted intense research attention since the first syntheses in 2010, as reflected in the sharply growing number of publications, which were mainly theoretical initially, and were followed by experimental studies. GDY-1 is a 2D carbon allotrope related to graphene, making it a carbon nanomaterial. It is also a molecular CON because GDY-1 can be synthesized from an organic monomer, HEB, via controlled oxidative homocoupling. The bottom-up approach can provide a variety of GDY derivatives by tuning the organic monomer. To overcome the irreversible alkyne–alkyne dimerization that complicates the precise fabrication of 2D GDY frameworks, a series of tactical synthetic procedures has been proposed, such as a gas–liquid interfacial synthesis and deposition of the monomer on metal surfaces. GDYs produced by these methods show various thicknesses, from subnanometer monolayers to micrometer-thick layers. A problem with GDY synthesis that is yet to be fully resolved is that of quality, particularly the suppression of random dimerization between the monomers. Outof-plane periodicity is an important but often overlooked aspect of nanosheet science. The stacking pattern of GDY-1 has been identified as affecting its properties, and the number of layers, including the monolayer, should be controlled. To increase the number of potential applications, the single domain size should be as large as possible, although a methodology to evaluate the quality remains to be developed. GDYs contain reactive butadiynyl or longer chains, and thus can be damaged by intense photon or electron incidence radiation. For example, Raman spectroscopy and TEM/SAED under relatively mild conditions are desired, and less-destructive analytic procedures, such as scanning probe microscopy and X-ray diffraction, should be used. Experimental exploration of geometric analogs of GDYs associated with fullerene, CNTs, and graphene nanoribbons is an area of future work. As predicted theoretically, these derivatives will have other functionalities and potential applications.",-1,
859,"ical attention. Calculations have shown it to be a semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.5–1.3 eV. The bandgap can be varied continuously to a zero-gap metal or a semimetal via lamination and transformation into nanoribbons or nanotubes. In addition, GDY-1 is expected to have a carrier mobility at room temperature greater than that of silicon, and rivaling that of graphene owing to properties such as its small effective mass. The characteristic structural features of GDYs, which derive from the large number of CC triple bonds, include high activity per unit volume and low atomic densities and are expected to allow GDYs to adsorb various chemicals. For example, Li or Na ions, gas molecules, and metal clusters may be adsorbed onto GDY-1, making it a candidate material for use in secondary batteries, filters, and aggregation-proof robust catalysts. The electronic structure of GDY-1 has been discussed thoroughly drawing on plentiful theoretical findings, although experimental verification remains insufficient. For example, its bandgap and band structure have not been determined experimentally. The highest experimental carrier mobility is of the order of 102 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is smaller than the theoretical value by three orders of magnitude (102 cm2 V−1 s−1 ). Future work should reconcile the theoretical and experimental values through using high-quality GDYs with controlled layering and stacking.",-1,
860,"A wide variety of potential applications has been demonstrated that exploit the features of GDYs, including the vast π-conjugation through the sp and sp2 carbons, acetylenic moieties capable of interacting with metal ions, large surface areas, high porosities, and tunable chemical structures. Herein, we have outlined their uses as electrocatalysts, organic reaction catalysts, energy storage devices, photoelectric conversion, photocatalysts, water purifiers, and sensors. In most cases, the GDY family itself, or GDYs hybridized with active materials, improved the performance of these devices. GDYs may play key roles in society in the future, by helping to solve globally important issues, such as environmental and energy threats, and by supporting the expanding networks of connected devices and sensors. Therefore, economical methods to mass-produce high-grade GDYs are required, and safety and stability tests and recycling or waste processing are also required for commercial viability.",-1,
861,"Research on the GDY family has begun in earnest, and further work will ensure it fulfils its potential. As a closing remark, we see it approaching its zenith in the forthcoming decade and shining light on various interdisciplinary fields.",-1,
862,"In summary, we have investigated the rate of electron scattering by optical phonons in GaAs/AIAs superlattices. The envelope-function approximation which reproduces long-wavelength optical phonons almost exactly has been employed. There is region of the layer thickness where damping is smaller than in the bulk. The results in the dielectric continuum model agree quite well with those in the envelope-function approximation and even the bulk-phonon model explains the layer thickness dependence reasonably well. We have calculated the Eliashberg function to show the contribution of individual modes. The dielectric continuum model is quite accurate in superlattices with wide layers but fails to describe individual modes for narrow layers. Although contributions of each modes are quite different, the total scattering rate becomes the same. ",-1,
863,"We have investigated the bipolar RS behavior of TiO2-based RRAM device by embedding an amorphous ZrO2 layer between Pt TE and TiO2. The RS characteristics of the Pt/ZrO2/TiO2/Pt bilayer structure device are greatly improved as compared to those of the Pt/TiO2/Pt device, such as lower power consumption and the improved uniformity of switching parameters such as switching voltages and resistances in high/low states. The improvement of the RS characteristics can be attributed to the amorphous ZrO2 layer which modifies the oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 layer.",24,
864,"The efficient generation of second and higher harmonics has been demonstrated using a BFO memristor. It is concluded that the PCEs at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th harmonics not only depend on amplitude of the sinusoidal input voltage but also on the symmetry of the hysteretic current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the memristor. For a given load resistor and sinusoidal input voltage, the power ratios of a memristor at 2nd harmonic with asymmetric hysteretic I-V curves are larger than the power ratios of a memristor with symmetric hysteretic I-V curves. We suggest to encode the input data in binary form (0, 1) by correspondingly switching the BFO memristor (LRS and HRS). Two distinguishable sets of harmonics are generated by a BFO memristor in LRS or HRS under sinusoidal input voltage with small reading amplitude. This can be used for a data transfer system with high data transfer security, reliability, and robustness. The security level of the system can be further increased by randomly choosing the input voltage VR, the analyzed harmonics, the fixed point range of load resistors, and a memristor from an array of memristors. The temperature dependence of the encryption system is not considered in this work. Nevertheless, the power ratio values could be different if the encoder and decoder are working at different temperatures. Another issue is the low frequency of hardware-based encoding and decoding. If look-up tables are included, which alters the system into partially software-based encoding and decoding, the frequency of encoding and decoding can be significantly enhanced.",26,
865,"We have synthesized WOx films via a thiourea-assisted route. AWOx-based device composed of Al(patterned top electrode)/ WOx/FTO(bottom electrode) RRAM and FTO/WOx/electrolyte/ ITO EC units is demonstrated. The EC unit possesses multiple transmittance states depending on the quantity of intercalated Li ions in the WOx films. On the other hand, the RRAM unit exhibits bipolar resistive switching behavior with an ON/OFF current ratio of more than 1 X 10^4. Cross-sectional TEM images reveal that the WOx film contains nanosized pores and metallic-W nanoclusters embedded in the tungsten oxide matrix. Multiple W-O bonding states are observed in the W 4f XPS spectrum, which implies the existence of oxygen vacancies in the WOx layer. In addition, some metallic-W nanoclusters are concentrated along the interface between the Al electrode and WOx film, which shall be accompanied with a substantial amount of oxygen vacancies near the Al/WOx interface. The nanosized pores in the WOx film facilitate the transport of Li ions for the modulation of transmittance, while the metallic-W clusters enhance the local electric field for the aggregation of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the rich oxygen vacancies near the Al/WOx interface play a decisive role in the formation/rupture of cone-shaped conductive paths during bipolar resistive switching. As a result, the specific microstructure of thiourea-assisted WOx film brings forth the multiple EC states and resistive switching behavior, which may be implemented to optical and electrical nonvolatile data storage devices, respectively.",1,
866,"In summary, first principles calculations are performed to investigate doping effects on the VO behaviors in ZrO2 such as the defect energy level and Ev. The results show that dopant chemical valence has significant impact on the VO behaviors while the effect of dopant ionic radius is weak. By doping trivalent ion such as Al or La into ZrO2, Ef is signifi-cantly decreased due to dipoles formed between dopants and VO. The results are interesting and conducive to design ZrO2-based RRAM devices for optimized performance.",24,
867,"Hence, the transition from insulating to metallic charge transport observed in step-annealed films of GeSb2Te4, GeSb4Te7, Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ge3Sb2Te6 can be understood as a disorder-induced MIT, driven by a change in charge-carrier mobility (or scattering rate) at almost constant charge-carrier density. This is in contrast to systems where the charge-carrier concentration is varied to achieve the MIT, for instance in Si:P with various phosphorus doping levels.",65,
868,"The impact of disorder on electron transport may be quantified by the resistivity ratio rσ , which can be employed to compare different PCMs. For GeTe,rσ increases from 3.5 to 4.5 on annealing, and therefore always shows metallic transport. For typical metals such as Al, Au or Ag, room-temperature values for rσ of several hundred are observed. For GeSb2Te4, instead, a change from values smaller than 1 to values larger than 1 for rσ is obtained (Fig. 4 bottom). It is therefore appropriate to compare the observed behaviour in GeSb2Te4 with amorphous and strongly disordered metals, where the resistance ratio rσ is typically around 5, leading to incipient Anderson localization44,45. For GeSb2Te4 at low annealing temperatures, an even smaller value is found, that is, rσ _x001C_1. Hence, we are encountering a crystalline state with localization effects more strongly expressed than in amorphous metals.",65,
869,"Interestingly, the MIT studied here already proceeds at elevated temperatures between 5 and 600 K, in contrast to the classical studies of Mott and Anderson transitions, which focus on the low-temperature limit (T → 0 K). The high degree of disorder, atomic as well as positional and thermal, present in PCMs on the pseudo-binary line between GeTe and Sb2Te3 is sensitive to small changes in annealing temperature, and thus enables tuning rσ from values smaller than 1 to values larger than 1. With electronic mean free paths of the order of 10 Å in crystalline solids, PCMs such as GeSb2Te4 or Ge2Sb2Te5 form a unique quantum state of matter.",65,
870,"Their universal electronic behaviour may be at the origin of the remarkable reproducibility of the resistance switching between insulating and metallic behaviour in these materials, crucial to large-scale applications of PCMs in non-volatile-memory devices. Finally, controlling the degree of disorder in the crystalline state might enable the realization of multilevel resistance states, hence employing disorder-induced localization in upcoming nonvolatile-storage devices. Equally important, the small mean free path of the charge carriers in conjunction with the crystalline state provides a unique opportunity to explore disorder-induced localization both experimentally and theoretically. In addition, the finite temperatures where the MIT is observed enable thermally induced effects to increase the tendency to localize electronic states. This opens the possibility to explore facets of disorder-induced localization not accessible in the past.",65,
871,"In summary, a double-layer stacked HfOx vertical RRAM has been demonstrated using a bit-costeﬀective fabrication process for the 3D integration. Excellent and consistent switching characteristics of the fabricated devices suggest the potential of stacking even more layers. A TiON interfacial layer is introduced for obtaining nonlinear I V curves. As a result, the LRS resistance gets increased at low applied bias for the unselected cells in an array, which is beneﬁcial for a cross-point array without an explicit cell selector. This work paves a technology path toward a 3D cross-point memory architecture with the emerging oxide-based RRAM devices. Future research directions include ﬁnding appropriate electrode materials that can replace Pt since Pt is not fully compatible with the CMOS integration process.",6,
872,"In summary, a simple and effective method, which is compatible with the photolithography and stripping of CMOS, is developed to improve resistive switching properties in both the ECM and VCM mechanisms of RRAM. Two kinds of nanoindented memory devices based on Ag/SiO2/Pt and W/Ta2O5/Pt are developed with an ultrahigh ON/OFF ratio, a sharp RESET process, excellent cell-to-cell uniformity, and a considerable response time and retention time. Moreover, a reasonable physical model is established to explain the better properties in the modified memory devices. We expect this method can provide guidance for fabricating high-performance and highstability memory applications. This work may promote the application of large-scale nanotransfer printing in RRAM.",0,
873,"In summary, a quantum dot based nonvolatile resistive memory device is demonstrated with ON/OFF ratio of 100. The retention and endurance test show good stability and reliability. The operating mechanism is proposed based on Coulomb blockade with charge trapping/de-trapping in quantum dots with metal-oxide layer serving as barrier. The memory devices are easy to fabricate, ultra-thin, and solution processed and have a low cost, promising to be one the potential candidates for the future memory applications.",0,
874,"In summary, the negative-set resistive switching behavior and reset failure behavior have been investigated in ITO/ MER/Al devices. In the negative-set process, the Al conductive filament grows into the MER active layer and extends into the ITO inert electrode. The impermeable graphene blocking layer is used to block the conductive filament penetrating and diffusing into the ITO electrode. As a result, the unexpected negative-set behavior is suppressed and reset failure behaviors were eliminated. In addition, the device shows satisfying resistive switching performances, including large on/off ratio of >103 and long retention time ∼104 s. The experimental result shows that the “pool” of active atoms in the counter electrode offer the cation source to lead to the negative-set behavior in the cation-based memory.",73,
875,"Electrical measurements, performed at 300 °K using a parameter analyzer and a conductive atomic force microscope (C-AFM) in ultra-high vacuum, are used to determine the ARC electrical properties. Modulation of the hafnia switching layer (HSL) current-voltage (I-V) dependence was accomplished by a current compliance (CC) limit setting in a parameter analyzer. Figure 1a depicts the experimentally
measured I-V sweeps for a PR-ARC over a random location ‘A’ on the HSL. Four
consecutive I-V sweeps are marked 1-4 where ‘1’ demonstrates initial aligned defect
states creation in the HSL (O-OV creation, defect like oxygen vacancies marked as
OV and mobile oxygen species marked as O) at the high end of a positive voltage
sweep; ‘2’ is a post forming sweep showing the overall higher conductivity through
the originally insulating HSL; ‘3’ is a negative voltage sweep showing the conductive
behavior in the reversed voltage polarity, followed by annihilation of some of the
defects (O-OV recombination) as evident by a sharp current drop at the negative end
and ‘4’ is a following negative voltage sweep showing a reduced conductivity
verifying the partial annihilation of defects. The indication for whether the ARC has a
rectifying nature or not is done through a comparison of the I-V behavior in the
positive and negative conductive regimes (thin dashed lines in Figure 1a, curves ‘2’
and ‘3’). For a given voltage V1, an overall symmetric behavior where I(V1) ≅ I(-V1) is
regarded a non-rectifying state while an asymmetric one where I(V1) >> I(-V1) (and
vice versa) is considered as rectifying. _x000D_",19,
876,"The non-trivial nature of ARC implementation is also highlighted in Figure 1. A state where current rectification was successfully achieved for an intermediate CC of 30 nA with a rectification ratio (RR) of I(V1)/I(-V1) ≅ 10 for V1 = 0.5 V is presented in Figure 1a. The use of either too low CC = 10 nA (Figure 1b) or too high CC = 90 nA (Figure 1c) yielded a symmetric or non-rectifying state for this specific location. Figure 1d shows a NR-ARC with RR ≅ 102 for 0.25 V on a different location ‘B’ while using a CC of 50 nA. The optimal CC is believed to be directly related to the localized structure, thickness and composition of the HSL. Different locations may thus require different CC conditions. However the overall potential to successfully produce an ARC is quite robust as will be demonstrated further by statistical data. The
concept of rectification flipping may be utilized in the formation of artificial synapses
by using a plurality of ARCs. Figure 1e and Figure 1f depict the consecutive flipping
of the rectification direction from PR to NR in yet another location ‘C’ using CC =
100 nA. Figure 1e shows PR-ARC with RR ≅ 103
 for 1.0 V and Figure 1f NR-ARC
with RR ≅ 102
 for 2.0 V. ",-1,
877,"Based on the simulation results (supplementary information – simulation progress movie), it can be seen that during formation, defects states migrate and align themselves starting from the cathode (charge injecting electrode) to form a conductive path towards the anode (opposite electrode). If this buildup process is arrested, by preventing the current from rising beyond a preset compliance, a partial conductive path separated by a “gap” (region of unbroken oxide) from the anode would be formed. This structure has a current rectifying property with the gap region presenting a higher injecting barrier after the electrode polarity is interchanged. In this sense, the formation of an ARC requires the careful manipulation of local oxide stoichiometry through an electrically driven defect formation process. A large CC will result in the formation of a continuous conductive path with symmetric I-V behavior as shown in Figure 1c. As for a low CC, defect formation is terminated at an early stage. The conductive path is sparsely populated and contains only one or two defected spots which results in a relatively symmetric tunneling barrier for current injected by both electrode and a symmetric current behavior. In the case of high CC, the defected formation process is allowed to continue until a well defined, defect rich and continuous (no gaps) conductive filament is formed which has an inherent symmetric current voltage dependence regardless of the injecting electrode.",-1,
878,"In summary, the authors presented a metal-oxide based nano-scale artificial rectifying connexon (ARC) which may be utilized to mimic biological connexons found in synaptic gap junctions. The structure is based on changing the local stoichiometry of a metal oxide thin film by manipulation of defect states to having high density at one end and an insulating gap at the other. Experimental measurements show that the structure has a current rectification property of up to 3 orders of magnitude which may be consecutively flipped to either forward or reverse direction to create either an excitatory or inhibitory (positive or negative) synaptic weight. Numerical analysis reveals that the rectification mechanism is based on electron tunneling which depends on both the trap profile and electron work function of the two electrodes. A plurality of ARCs may thus be used to create a rectifying synaptic gap junction. In addition, the plasticity of each junction may be altered by changing the ratio of the number of
forward to reverse ARCs. plasticity of each junction may be altered by changing the ratio of the number of

The synaptic barristor in a three-terminal configuration could implement fundamental synaptic functions, including STP, PPF, LTP, and LTD, with external gate controllability.

882,The data reported in this paper have shown that the so- called pulse mode can trigger a change of conductivity in our device with the same efficiency as in the dc mode we have used so far.,-1,
883,"The comparison between data reported in Figs. 3 and 4 reveals that the pulse duration is not a parameter that can inhibit significantly the variations in the conductivity. It al- lows to be confident that we will very likely observe similar phenomena when we will work with potential pulses of du- ration comparable with that of the neuronal signals, if the correct ratio between pulse duration and interval between pulses is provided.",-1,
884,"The experiments on the mimicking of learning processes have shown that the pulse mode is even more effective than the dc mode. For the dc case, the increment in current after training was of about 50% of the initial value, while in the pulse case, the output increases by a factor of 2 or more, which is comparable to the increase in signal transmission found in trained Lymnea specimen. The adaptations were confirmed as repeatable and reversible. It is to be noted that, even if we did not build an actual circuit with different inputs as it happened with the dc case, it is perfectly feasible to do so; it just requires the utilization and synchronization of mul- tiple source units. This is the reason why we chose simply to apply to the device the sum of the different inputs simulated.",-1,
885,"In general, our device has been proven as a very suitable candidate for the realization of a circuit that mimics the learning behavior and characteristics of biological neuronal networks, both in dc mode and pulse mode. The possibility of achieving very effective and reversible adaptations, both excitatory and inhibitory, should enable us in the near future to use multiple devices in networks with numerous inputs and outputs, and to perform both supervised and unsuper-vised learning of such networks.",39,

The device with W top electrode can switch 104 times without obvious degradation and the memory window is well kept. The switching behavior can be explained by the oxygen vacancy migration to connect/disconnect the conductive filaments at the interface.",1,
887,"In this work, NiO thin films were fabricated by a spincoating process followed by thermal annealing. Switching characteristics were observed when positive bias was applied to the Pt or Au electrode in NiO-based devices. When positive bias was applied to the Ti or Al electrode, switching characteristics disappeared. The formation and the shape of CF can be influenced by the oxygen vacancies in the NiO film thus CF near anode is thinner than that near cathode. A conical model of CF is proposed and adopted in the simulation and analysis. The results show that CF near anode is easily fused in the Pt/NiO/Pt and Au/NiO/Pt structure thus the reset process can be achieved, while CF cannot be dissolved when Ti or Al is served as anode material due to decreased obviously dissolution velocity of CF near the anode of the oxygen-getting materials, such as Ti and Al, which is verified in the AES analysis and results in no reset process and no resistive switching.",29,
888,"In conclusion, we have fabricated amorphous a-IGZO thin films on Pt, Au, Al, and ITO substrates by a PLD method. Resistance switching effects were observed indicat- ing that a-IGZO thin film has a bistable resistance state. The I-V curves at small bias reveal a space charge limited con- duction mechanism in a-IGZO thin film and the resistance switching effect is independent of electrodes. In addition, a-IGZO thin film has good optical transparency in the visible range. We suggest that the origin of resistance switching ef- fect in a-IGZO thin films is the forming and rupturing of conducting paths by an external bias within the a-IGZO ma- trix and a-IGZO thin films can be considered as candidates for amorphous transparent resistive random-access memory devices.",-1,
889,"In summary, we investigated the microstructures and resistive switching behaviors of Fe-STO films deposited at various temperatures. Films deposited at 250 ℃ and 450 ℃ were amorphous Fe-STO films with smooth, dense surfaces, while 600 ℃-deposited Fe-STO films were polycrystalline with an average grain size of 50 nm and 800 ℃-deposited Fe-STO films exhibited cracked morphologies and surface segregation of Sr-rich nano-sheets. Amorphous, 450 ℃-deposited Fe-STO films exhibited the best bipolar resistive switching characteristics: an ultra-low switching voltage of <60.6 V, a high ON/OFF ratio of ×105 , and a good endurance of more than 2500 cycles. Polycrystalline Fe-STO films deposited at 600 ℃ exhibited cycling-dependent resistive switching patterns. Doped Fe atoms enhanced oxygen vacancy CF formation in STO films, thus significantly decreasing switching voltages.

The Ti/n-Si(001) diode provided adequate internal current compliance for the resistance switching of the RRAM device. The acquired 1D1R RRAM showed robust properties even after 68 SET/RESET operation loops.

897,"Figure 4(a) shows the typical switching current–voltage (I–V) curve of the SiCOH-based RRAM. From the test results, we found that all the devices were forming-free. During the measurement, we found that none of the devices required a high initial voltage to achieve a low-resistance state. Many devices even initially had a lower set voltage. Thus, we concluded that the devices are forming-free. A voltage was applied to the top electrode (50 µm side length) and the bottom electrode was grounded. In addition, a compliance current of 10−4 A was applied during the SET process to prevent the devices from breaking down. All the measurements were performed in an atmospheric environment. Figure 4(b) shows the switching I–V curve of the SiO2- based device.

Among them, Figs. 5(b) and 5(d) show the properties of the SiO2-based device. These figures clearly demonstrate that the SiO2-based RRAM could only be operated a maximum of 20 times in atmospheric environment.

904,"The performance of the device is low, considering that the write/erase times are on the order of 1 s, and retention is on the order of 10^6 s. Improvements of the device can, in principle, be made by optimizing the storage layer and gate stack properties. Previously we have predicted that, in a flash memory, a large retention time accompanied with fast write/ erase times are possible by using high-j dielectrics in the gate stack and nanocrystals in the storage layer. The sizes of the devices are also large for high density neuromorphic computing, however, there is no significant variation of threshold voltages and charging characteristics by changing the dimensions within the micrometer range. We therefore estimate that the devices can, in principle, be scaled into the nanoscale regime, unless short channel effects become significant. There are a large number of variations on flash memory devices and programming modes. Among the mechanisms used for writing into storage layers, Hot Electron Injection (HEI) is widely used to speed up write times. In the presented devices, the HEI are insignificant as the size of the device is much greater than the thermalization length of carriers. HEI can become more important as the devices are scaled down to the nanometer range. In conclusion, the flashristor mode may allow high density neuromorphic computing applications using the readily available flash memory technology, extending the use of charge storage memories to future computational architectures.",-1,
905,"An adaptive codeword ECC is proposed for the low power and highly reliable NV-RAM and NAND flash memory integrated SSD. The NV-RAM write buffer compensates the 10–100 times speed gap between the NAND flash memory and the SSD interface and realizes the 10 Gbps write. During the read, the read data output from the NAND flash memory to the NV-RAM/NAND controller by bypassing NV-RAM. At 10 Gbps, the proposed SSD decreases the power consumption by 97%. In the proposed adaptive codeword ECC, errors of both NV-RAM and the NAND flash memory are corrected without circuit area overhead. The ECC codeword, the data unit where ECC is performed, is adaptively optimized for NV-RAM and NAND flash memory. As a result, the acceptable raw bit error rate before ECC increases by 3.6 times without ECC circuit area or power consumption penalty.",23,
906,"4. We find, at fixed stellar mass, more Ca_ii in the halo of star-forming galaxies than quiescent ones by a factor of a few.",15,
907,"1. The SFR dependence of the amount of Ca_ii is similar to that of the highly ionized O_vi recently found by the HST COShalos team (Tumlinson et al. 2011). These results imply that star formation, or a process correlated with star formation, is responsible either for injecting Ca_ii and O_vi into the halo or keeping a large amount of calcium and oxygen in the halo in certain physical condition. The azimuthal angle dependence of Ca_ii and Mg_ii absorption (Bordoloi et al. 2011, 2012; Kacprzak et al. 2011; Bouche et al. 2012; K. H. R. Rubin et al., in preparation), which shows that low-ionization gas is more abundant and more kinematically violent in the polar direction of edge-on galaxies, suggests that bipolar outflows driven by star formation must have played a significant role in injecting metals into the halo. This is also in agreement with the ubiquitous outflows found in poststarburst/star-forming galaxy spectra at various redshifts (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2007; Weiner et al. 2009; Rubin et al. 2010, see Steidel et al. 2010 for more evidence and a review). Following a period of star formation, the fate of Ca_ii ions is unclear.",15,
908,"In summary, we have demonstrated the transient responses of the pulse wave form in Ag/Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 /Pt thin films. The colossal electroresistance (CER) phenomenon is over two orders of magnitude, even at room temperature. The set operation from high to low resistance is faster than the reset operation from low to high resistance. The threshold transient times needed to obtain the largest CER ratio are estimated at 100 ns for the set and 135 ns for the reset operations at a pulse amplitude of 2 V. This gives it major potential as nonvolatile memory technology characterized by the useful characteristics of fast response and low power consumption. The collective nature in the trap- filling and -defilling processes due to strong electron correlation may play a key role in the CER phenomenon.",49,
909,"We used a-LSMO thin films to develop an analog memristor. The Ag/a-LSMO/Pt memristor notably exhibited excellent pinched hysteresis loops under high excitation frequency, and the area enclosed by the pinched hysteresis loops shrank with increasing excitation frequency. The memristor also showed continuously tunable synapselike resistance and stable endur_xFFFE_ance (up to 1000 set−reset pulse cycles). The C-AFM current_xFFFE_mapping images and the low-temperature-dependent resistan_xFFFE_ces of the HRS and LRS showed that Ag nanofilaments had formed during electroforming. The a-LSMO thin films in this memristor acted as a solid electrolyte for Ag+ cations, and only the Ag/a-LSMO/Pt cells electroformed to an HRS resistance below 1/G0 easily exhibited high-frequency pinched hysteresis loops. On the basis of the ECM theory and electrical transport models of quantum wires and nanowires, we derived that the memristance, R, was ultimately determined by the amount of charge, q, supplied by the external current. The state equations for the memristor were established, and q was the state variable. This study provided a new analog memristor based on metal nanofilaments thickening/thinning in ECM cells, which could be extended to other RRAM materials. This memristor may enable the development of beyond von Neumann computers.",42,

916,"In summary, multilevel bipolar resistive switching with all on/off ratios _x0001_20 was observed in Cu/TaOx /Pt structures, which might be promising for developing multivalue memory devices with high reliability. Besides, since the system possesses three intrinsic resistance states, it is expected to be especially suitable for tristate logic applications. From a physical point of view, this structure may serve as a model system for investigating the coupling effect between existing resistive switching mechanisms. Further work includes manipulating the multilevel resistance switching by pulse stimuli and developing prototype tristate logic devices, which are both in progress.",0,
917,"In summary, we attribute the cumulative effects of identical SET/RESET pulses to different processes. In the SET process, the limited time interval in which the voltage is applied is not sufficient to establish the positive feedback that leads to abrupt the resistance transitions found with voltage ramps and, in the meanwhile, the positive feedback can be mitigated by the opposite switching tendencies developing at opposite interfaces as explained above. The effect of repeated pulses on the RESET operation, even if limited, is found when amplitudes and timewidths are chosen in such a way that the process is slow enough not to be completed in one single pulse.",5,
918,"Amorphous KN ﬁlms were grown on a TiN−Si substrate at 350 °C to fabricate a KN memristor. The Pt/KN/TiN memristor shows ﬁve resistance states by applying diﬀerent Vreset values: one LRS and four HRSs. These resistance levels show good electrical reliability, proving that the KN memristor can be used as an artiﬁcial synapse with the various strengths of synaptic weight. The conductance of the KN memristor can be modulated by the application of repetitive DC bias, indicating that the transmission behavior observed in biological synapses can be realized in the KN memristor. Moreover, the KN memristor exhibits a nearly linear conductance change, without a gap between the ﬁnal stage of the potentiation process and the initial stage of the depression process, upon the application of uniform pulses. Therefore, the KN memristor has transmission properties appropriate for its application to neuromorphic computing systems. Several synaptic plasticity characteristics including STP/LTP transition, SRDP, PPF, and PTP were implemented in the KN memristor through the control of the spike rate and number. STDP was also obtained from the KN memristor by controlling the temporal relation between the pre- and post-spikes. Metaplasticity of long-term potentiation (and long-term depression) was observed in the KN memristor by applying the priming P-spike (or priming D-spike) before the main P-spike (or D-spike), and this eﬀect was explained by the variations of the width and length of the oxygen vacancy ﬁlaments. The metaplasticity eﬀect of STDP was also realized in the KN memristor. Application of a priming P-spike (or a priming D-spike) increased the ΔW values at Δt > 0 (or the ΔW values at Δt < 0). Therefore, it can be concluded that the KN memristor is a good candidate for an artiﬁcial synapse.",3,
