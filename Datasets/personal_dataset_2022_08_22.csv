"Metal dopants play an important role in the resistive switching mechanism of HfO2-based resistive random access memory (RRAM), which can improve the performance of the RRAM device. Although Cu and Gd ions as metal dopants were widely explored, Au dopant is little focused so far. So the effects of Au doping in defect-free m-HfO2 using the first-principles calculation were investigated in this paper, with the purpose of revealing the contribution of dopants in the forming process of conducting filaments (CFs). Based on the first principle, the statistical models are firstly built to simulate the system of the Au-doped m-HfO2 with and without an oxygen vacancy (Vo). Then the electronic properties, the charge transfer of atoms, and the interaction between Au dopants and Vos are calculated and analyzed. The results show that the formation energy of the Au-dopant at the interstitial site is 5.673eV less than that of the Au-dopant at the substitutional site, which means the interstitial site is found to be the more stable position. Moreover, the interstitial Au dopant induces gap states of Hf and O atoms into the band gap of m- HfO2. As a result, the conductivity of the Au-HfO2 and the Au-HfO2-Vo systems is enhanced substantially. The results of the DOS, the band structure and the partial charge density show that the intermediate energy level crosses over the Fermi level and the electrons could connect the Audopant with nearby Hf atoms. According to these results, it is found that the Au CFs can be generated in the process of doping. In addition, the Vos at different positions near the Au-dopant have diverse formation energies, which highly indicate that these Vos are involved in the forming of the CFs. It may be concluded that the Vos CFs and the Au-dopants can be formed and play a role in the process of the resistive switching.",Abstract
"With the development of memories, non-volatile memories have drawn more and more attention due to their low energy consumption. In the family of non-volatile memories, resistive random access memory (RRAM) is one of the most promising members that have a great potential application in the future. The typical structure of RRAM cells is the simple metal-insulator-metal (MIM) sandwich configuration. There are many choices of the resistive switching materials, among which HfO2 makes itself striking because of its thermodynamic stability, high break-down electric filed, simple constituent and compatibility in the process of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) field effect transistor [1]. All the time, the resistive switching mechanism in the HfO2-based RRAM has been widely studied.",Introduction
"At present, the physical mechanism based on the conducting filaments (CFs) theory in HfO2 is believed to be the dominating mechanism in most cases [1?6]. There are two kind microscopic mechanisms of CFs, which are the oxygen vacancies (Vos) filament and metal ions filament, respectively. Vos filament is usually generated during the migration process of Vos under biased voltage. Metal filament formed by the migration of metal ions which come from metal dopants in HfO2 or oxidation of electrode during the process of the resistive switching. Besides, there are complex interactions between the metal ions and Vos. Haemori et al. reported Cu can diffuse from the electrode into the HfO2 layer, which results in the formation of the Cu conductive filaments (Cu CFs) [5]. Wang et al. also demonstrated the existence of the Cu CFs in the HfO2 thin film. Additionally, a layer of Cu was inserted in HfO2 in order to increase the concentration of Cu dopants [6]. However, one problem is that the randomicity of the CFs' formation, which always leads to poor uniformity of the resistive switching behaviors [7?9]. Metal Al [10] and Gd [11,12] as the dopants were also studied both experimentally and theoretically, whose results show that the properties of the resistive switching materials can be altered and hence the performance of RRAM devices were improved. But not all dopants contribute to the formation of the metal CFs. Dai et al. investigated eleven metal dopants in the HfO2-based RRAM. Their researches find that the conduction filament in HfO2 is directly formed by the interstitial metals rather than the substitutional metals, and the interstitial metal dopants have a strong assistant effect on the Vos CFs while the substitutional metal dopants have a minor assistant effect on the Vos CFs [13].",Introduction
"It was reported that devices based on Au-doped HfO2 show improved uniformity, increased ON/OFF ratio, and reduced set voltage [14]. However, since Au is a member of coinage metals, few people refer to the effects of Au dopant. In this paper, the effects of Au dopant in m-HfO2-based RRAM are investigated in theory. First-principles calculations are carried out to study Au-doped m-HfO2 with and without Vos (Au-HfO2 and Au-HfO2-Vo). Electronic structures of these two systems, charge transfer of atoms, and the interaction between Au dopants and Vos are studied and analyzed. Finally, the contribution of the Au dopants in the formation of the CFs is revealed.",Introduction
"First-principles calculations are based on the density functional theory (DFT) with the Perdew Burke Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) [15] for the exchange correlation potential. Projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials are used for the description of ion-electron interactions [16]. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis is chosen to be 400 eV and the Brillouin zone is sampled at the ¥Ã point. Gaussian broadening is used with a width of 0.1 eV to smear the density of states. Monoclinic HfO2 supercell of 96 atoms is built. One Au atom is put into the interstitial and substitutional sites respectively as the dopant, and one O atom is removed as the oxygen vacancy. All the calculations are carried out by VASP. The optimized structural parameters are given in Table 1, and differences from other work and experimental data are within 2%.",Methods
"In order to study the possible behavior of Au doping in m-HfO2, the doped Au atom occupying different positions in the lattice, such as three interstitial positions (Position 1, Position 2, and Position 3) and a substitutional position, are considered. As shown in Fig. 1, the original interstitial positions are determined by the coordinates of four O atoms surrounding the Au dopant. For the substitutional position, the site of one Hf atom near the center of the supercell is chosen. Whether a position is favored or not is decided by the formation energy of the dopant. The lower the formation energy, the higher the chance that the Au dopant is in this position will be. The formation energy Efor (D) of a neutral defect D can be calculated by the following equation (1) [17].",Main
"In this section, the band structure, the density of states (DOS) and the partial charge density are calculated to investigate the electronic structures of the Au-HfO2 system. The model of Au doped in m-HfO2 is a supercell in which initial position of the Au dopant is position 1. Fig. 2 (a) displays the two intermediate energy levels in the band gap of m-HfO2 introduced by the interstitial Au dopant. The upper one (the red line in Fig. 2 (a)) crosses over the Fermi level and is close to the bottom of the conduction band, which means the conductivity of m-HfO2 has been enhanced. These two intermediate energy levels are consistent with the total gap states in Fig. 2 (c). There is a peak appear at about ?2.5eV, while another one is at the Fermi level. The gap states near ?2.5eV are mainly derived from O-p states and Au-d states. Those around the Fermi level are mainly composed of O-p states, Au-s states, and Hf-d states. Compared the intensity of the partial DOS (PDOS) of Au, Hf and O atoms, the Au dopant itself only contributes a small part to the total gap states. What matters more is that the Au doped in HfO2 can induce the gap states of O and Hf atoms.",Main
"The isosurface plots of partial charge density for the two intermediate energy levels are shown in Fig. 3, which confirms our results above. In Fig. 3 (a), the electrons are gathered around the Au dopant, indicating that the O-p states, Au-s states, and Hf-d states contribute to the upper intermediate energy level. The electrons connect the Au dopant with nearby Hf atoms, leading to the formation of the conductive path. In Fig. 3 (b), the electrons are accumulated near the Au dopant and O atoms, which correspond to the contribution of O-p states and Au-d states to the lower intermediate energy level. Moreover, it's pretty clear that the electrons near O atoms form a shape of dumbbell, which is the typical shape of p orbitals. Those electrons around Au dopant form a shape of flower, which is the typical shape of d orbitals.",Main
"Fig. 4 shows that the local DOS (LDOS) of Hf atoms (Hf18, Hf19, and Hf29) and O atoms (O57, O63, and O35) near the Au dopant. The similar features appear in Figs. 2 and 4 (c). For the Hf atoms, the lower valence band is mainly consisted of s orbital electrons and d orbital electrons. The upper valence band and the conduction band are mainly consisted of d orbital electrons. For the O atoms, the lower and upper valence bands are mostly composed of s orbital electrons and p orbital electrons respectively. The density of states of the conduction band is relatively low. The O and Hf atoms closing to the Au-dopant are unique because they own gap states. The gap states of Hf atoms and O atoms are separately derived from d orbital electrons and p orbital electrons. All Hf atoms and O atoms in the Au-HfO2 system devote to forming the gap states. The electronic structures of the Au-HfO2 system demonstrate that the Au dopants directly involve in generating the conducting filaments without the presence of Vos.",Main
"Take the supercell in which the Au dopant originally stays at Position 3 as an example. Nearby O atoms and their distance to the Au dopant are shown in Fig. 5 (a). These O atoms will be removed respectively to create the Vos, of which the formation energies are calculated, and the results are shown in Table 3. The fourfold Vo36, with the smallest distance to the Au dopant, has the lowest formation energy. It's about 3.915eV. The formation energies are different as a result of the different distance to the Au dopant. But the similar trend is not observed in the threefold Vos. Although the distance between Vo41 and the Au dopant is larger than that between Vo5 and the Au dopant, the formation energy of Vo41 is almost the same as that of Vo5. These results are consistent with that dopants can significantly reduce the formation energies of nearby Vos [10,12,13,18]. Moreover, the threefold Vos are easier to form due to their lower formation energies than those of the fourfold Vos. Table 4 shows the lowest formation energy of fourfold or threefold Vos and their distance to the Au dopant. The locations of these Vos are shown in Figs. 4 (a), 5 (a) and (b). For the Au dopant in the different interstitial positions, when Vos have almost the same distance from the Au dopant, their formation energies are the same regardless of the type of Vos. According to the data from Tables 3 and 4, the Vos near the Au dopant are more stable. Vo35 and Vo63 for the Au dopant in position 1 and position 2 as well as Vo5 and Vo41 for the Au dopant in position 3 are the easiest to be created and most likely to participate in the formation of the CFs. The interaction energies of the dopant and the easiest-created threefold or fourfold Vos are calculated. These values are also nearly the same. The average interaction energy of the Au dopant and a threefold Vo is ?4.766eV, and that of the Au dopant and a fourfold Vo is ?2.933eV, which means there is a strong attraction between the dopant and the Vo. This indicates that the Vo CFs are easier to be generated and are probably adjacent to the Au CFs, which is in agreement with the Au dopants' ability to suppress the randomicity of the Vo CFs' formation [14]. Therefore, both the two kinds of CFs play an important role during the process of the resistive switching.",Main
"In order to investigate the electronic structures of the Au-HfO2-Vo system, the band structure and the DOS are calculated. The supercell in which the dopant originally stays at Position 1 is taken as an example to make a comparison with the system without Vo. Here O35 is removed to create the Vo. In Fig. 2 (b), the upper intermediate energy level crosses over the Fermi level and it is closer to the bottom of the conduction band, which show that the conductivity of the Au-HfO2-Vo system are better than that of the Au-HfO2 system. In Fig. 2 (d), there are still two peaks of the total gap states. As for the gap states near ?2.5eV, they are mainly derived from O-p orbital electrons, Au-s orbital electrons, and Hf-d orbital electrons. Those gap states near the Fermi level are mainly derived from O-p orbital electrons, Au-p orbital electrons and Hf-d orbital electrons. By comparison the intensity of the PDOS for Hf and O atoms, the contribution of Hf-d orbital electrons to the total gap states increases, while the contribution of O-p orbital electrons decreases in the Au-HfO2-Vo system. Take the LDOS for O57, O63, and O35 into consideration, the intensity of gap states for O35 is the highest. Thus, once it's removed, the intensity of the gap states for all O atoms decreases dramatically.",Main
"Charge transfer of all Hf and O atoms in the Au-HfO2 and Au-HfO2-Vo systems are evaluated by the Bader charge analysis. The supercell in which the dopant originally stays at Position 1 is used. Bader partitioning is a robust partitioning scheme based on the charge density [19]. In Fig. 6 (a), the average loss of charges for Hf atoms is about 2.340. In the Au-HfO2 system, Hf atoms near the Au dopant lose fewer electrons than those far away. For instance, Hf18 loses 0.04 electrons below the average, while Hf29 loses 0.09 electrons. In the Au-HfO2-Vo system, except for Hf26, the amount of charges lost by nearby Hf atoms is even less. Hf18 loses 0.14 electrons below the average, and Hf29 loses 0.17 electrons. The change in charge transfer of Hf3 is also dramatic. In the Au-HfO2 system, its charge transfer stays at the average. In the Au-HfO2-Vo system, it loses 0.07 electrons below the average. In Fig. 6 (b), the average values obtained by the threefold O atoms and fourfold O atoms are about 1.15 and 1.20. In the Au-HfO2 system, O atoms near the Au dopant get fewer charges than those far away. The threefold O35 which is the nearest O atom to the Au dopant obtains about 0.08 electrons below the average. While in the Au-HfO2-Vo system, the amount of electrons obtained by O35 atoms gets back to average.",Main
"In a word, the amount of electrons lost by Hf atoms in the Au-HfO2-Vo system is less due to the existence of the Au dopant, which is in agreement with the XPS result of Tan et al. They observed a shift to the lower binding energy of Hf 4f peaks for the Au-doped HfO2 film [14]. As a consequence, O atoms near the dopant in the Au-HfO2 system tend to obtain fewer electrons. After O35 is removed to create the Vo, as there is acting as one electron acceptor, Hf atoms (Hf3, Hf18, Hf29) originally bonded with this O atom lose even fewer electrons. The amount of electrons received by other nearby O atoms is increasing. Due to Hf19 and Hf26 which is a little bit far from O35, the influence of removing the O35 atom on them is small. So the loss of electrons either increases or almost stays unchanged.",Main
"Based on the first principle, the influence of the Au dopants in the defect-free m-HfO2 and especially nearby Hf and O atoms is calculated and investigated at the atom-scale. The results show that the Au dopant favors the interstitial sites but there is no preference for different interstitial sites. The DOSs and partial charge density of the Au-HfO2 and the Au-HfO2-Vo systems indicate that two intermediate energy levels are introduced into the band gap of m-HfO2, leading to the improvement of the conductivity. The O and of Hf atoms near the Au dopant play a more important role in forming the total gap states, which are composed of the O-p and Hfd orbital electrons. Therefore, whether or not there are Vos, the Au CFs can be generated. In the Au-HfO2-Vo system, the Vos nearby the Au dopant are easier to be created. The threefold Vo5 and Vo41 have the lowest formation energies among all Vos, which shows that they contribute more to the formation of the Vo CFs. Thus, the randomicity of the Vo CFs' formation can be suppressed by the Au doping. According to the charge transfer of atoms, O and Hf atoms near the Au-dopant obtain and lose fewer electrons respectively in the Au-HfO2 system. However, in the Au-HfO2-Vo systems, the amount of electrons obtained by O atoms near the Au-dopant goes back to the average value. As for the Hf atoms nearby the Au dopant, the trend is irregular. In conclusion, both the Vo CFs and the Au CFs could be involved in the process of the resistive switching, and the validity of the Au dopants' application in RRAM devices is proved.",Summary

"Non-volatile memory cells are exposed to adversary attacks since any active countermeasure is useless when the device is powered off. In this context, this work proposes the association of two serial RRAM devices as a basic cell to store sensitive data, which could solve this bothersome problem. This cell has three states: ¡®1¡¯, ¡®0¡¯, and masked. When the system is powered off or the data is not used, the cell is set to the masked state, where the cell still stores a ¡®1¡¯ or a ¡®0¡¯ but a malicious adversary is not capable of extracting the stored value using reverse engineering techniques. Before reading, the cell needs to be unmasked and it is masked afterwards until the next reading request. The operation of the cell also provides robustness against side-channel attacks. The presented experimental results confirm the validity of the proposal.",Abstract
"In the IoT era, the ubiquitous use of sensitive and private data requires reliable and secure embedded systems where a reasonable amount of memory is required for security code encryption or key storage. This sensitive data is commonly stored in embedded non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as ROM, e-fuse (electronic-fuse) or anti-fuse, batterybacked SRAMs or logic EEPROM/Flash. Masked ROM memories store keys during manufacturing. Therefore, a change in the key requires modifying the mask layout. Efuse [1] and anti-fuse [2,3] are one-time programmable (OTP) memories, which can be built in a generic digital process, but the programming operation is irreversible. A battery-backed SRAM is a power-gated SRAM in data retention mode. The battery is required to avoid the volatility of SRAM memories, at the expense of an increase in cost, complexity, and power consumption. Logic EEPROM/Flash [4?6] are based on the floating gate technology and have been successfully deployed in automotive microcontroller units (MCU) and smartcard ICs.",Introduction
"However, they are still expensive and require additional masks and process steps in comparison with the standard CMOS technology. All these NVMs present the same security vulnerability, since data remain in the memory even without power, exposing it to potential attackers. Confidentiality attacks aim at extracting this stored information. In the case of NVMs, attackers aiming at stealing private data can succeed in their objective with the aid of cold-boot attacks or other removal strategies like stealing memory modules [7,8]. As an alternative, secret keys can also be extracted from security primitives, the so-called physical unclonable functions (PUFs) [9]. PUFs are physical structures that embrace manufacturing variations resulting from the IC fabrication process to generate a key. Although PUFs provide a promising alternative for a key generation [10], they still pose challenges like low reliability, need for error detection and area overhead.",Introduction
"In this context, resistive random access memories (RRAMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to replace current memories [11,12]. Moreover, the inherent variability of RRAMs, due to the stochastic nature of their switching mechanism [13], has positioned these devices as one of the most competitive candidates for the development of security primitives [14]. In fact, RRAMs have attracted the attention of the research community for the implementation of PUFs [15?23] and true random number generators (TRNGs) [24?29]. Nevertheless, RRAM-based circuits may also introduce security vulnerabilities of their own. One of the main concerns is related to its inherent non-volatility, since data written to the memory persist even when the system is powered off, arising a similar problem as present NVMs. This fact may expose RRAMs to a variety of physical attacks, compromising data confidentiality [30]. For this reason, extensive effort is currently devoted to improving the security of RRAM-based memories. These approaches propose security improvements at the physical or circuit level [31?34] and at the authentication or encryption level [35,36]. However, all these proposed approaches still do not address the fundamental problem of privacy data remaining in memory after the power is turned off.",Introduction
"The present paper proposes the association of two RRAMs in a serial configuration as a basic cell for secure NVMs, which could solve this critical problem. This cell has already been proposed for other security applications [25,37,38]. However, unlike these previous works, in this paper the cell is excited in such a way that the deterministic switch of one of the RRAMs is obtained. The configurations of the cell where both devices are in different resistance states are leveraged to store one bit of information. The operation of the cell provides also the capability of masking and unmasking the data on demand. With this countermeasure the protection against physical attacks is enhanced when the device is powered off or when the sensitive data is not used. Furthermore, side-channel attacks that conduct information stealing by monitoring the current consumption are preventable in this work. The presented experimental results are a proof of concept that validates the applicability of the proposed cell. Moreover, a potential array architecture based on the serial RRAMs memory cell is proposed and its ability to defend the physical attacks is discussed.",Introduction
"The rest of the work is organized as follows. A short review about the use of RRAM devices as memory cells and related security aspects is found in Section 2. The serial RRAM memory cell and its functionality details are presented in Section 3. Next, experimental results are summarized in Section 4. An array architecture proposal based on the serial RRAM cell is found in Section 5. The security features arising from the cell and the proposed array architecture are discussed in Section 6. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 7.",Introduction
"The considered serial RRAM memory cell is a kind of differential cell in which bits can be concealed. As shown in Figure 3, it consists of two RRAMs connected in series. Four different cell states can be identified from the two possible resistance states of each RRAM, see Figure 4: (HRS, LRS) ! ¡®0¡¯, (LRS, HRS) ! ¡®1¡¯, (LRS, LRS) ! MASKED in the LRS, (HRS, HRS) ! MASKED in the HRS (NOT USED) . The behavior of the cell is as follows: with the two RRAMs initially in the LRS, during a serial RESET (SRESET), i.e., a RESET operation of the two serially connected devices, one of the RRAMs switches to the HRS first. When the SRESET is initiated, the voltage across the switching device increases, preventing the other device to switch. During a subsequent serial SET (SSET), i.e., a SET operation of the two serially connected devices, only the RRAM in the HRS switches back to the LRS, since the other one is already in the LRS. For subsequent SSET and SRESET the switching device is always the same. The basic operation of the cell is reported in Figure 5. Furthermore, considering the unused configuration in which both RRAMs are masked in the HRS, one of the RRAMs switches first to the LRS in the subsequent SSET operation, which raises the voltage across the other non-switching RRAM device, forcing it to switch to the LRS as well. In this case, both devices may end up in the LRS if the SSET voltage is not withdrawn in time, compromising the functionality of the cell. That is the main reason why this configuration (HRS, HRS) is not adopted here. Given a particular pair of devices initially in the LRS, by applying consecutive SRESET and SSET operations the bit can be unmasked and masked, respectively. Depending on which of the RRAMs switches to the HRS after a SRESET, two different states of the cell can be differentiated (the so-called ¡®0¡¯ or ¡®1¡¯). The RRAM that goes first to the HRS depends on device-to-device variability. Therefore, every cell generates an unpredictable bit, which is maintained during subsequent SRESET and SSET operations. Furthermore, it adds masking capability since both devices remain in the LRS after a SSET. This fact can be exploited to generate unpredictable bits with the potential application in PUFs [38].",Main
"This serial RRAM cell is proposed in the present work for secure NVMs. However, for this application, we must include writing capabilities to obtain a full operational memory cell. This fact requires the capability of writing data to the cell while maintaining the feature of masking/unmasking the bit. For this purpose, during the write operation, individual SET and RESET operations are applied so that the middle node Vap2 is grounded and nodes Vap1 and Vap3 are biased accordingly, as illustrated in Figure 6a,b for write-0 and write-1 operations, respectively. During masking and unmasking operations the middle node Vap2 is left floating and voltages at nodes Vap1 and Vap3 are applied accordingly.",Main
"The masking operation is performed by bringing the two RRAMs to LRS with a SSET, which forces the same current passing through both devices, see Figure 6c,d. After this operation, it is arduous to know what the previous combination of states (HRS, LRS) or (LRS, HRS) was. However, if an unmasking operation (SRESET) is applied (forcing the same current through both devices) the previous state (HRS, LRS) or (LRS, HRS) is restored, see Figure 6e,f. With the cell in an unmasked state, a read operation (SREAD) is conducted, as illustrated in Figure 6g,h. Node Vap3 is grounded and the read voltage is applied to node Vap1 while the voltage at the floating node Vap2 is measured and compared to a reference voltage to read the bit. The complete behavior of the cell is demonstrated next.",Main
"According to the different configurations of the cell reported in Figure 6, a full operation of the cell can be derived, as the sequence of operations illustrated in Figure 7. Starting from both devices in the LRS, a write operation is applied to the cell to store the secret bit (write-0 in Figure 7a and write-1 in Figure 7b). Subsequently, a masking operation is applied to conceal the bit. Then, the secret can be revealed on demand by applying an unmasking operation followed by a read operation. Once the information has been obtained, the secret is masked again. This sequence of operations (unmasking-read-masking) can be applied as many times as needed. In this way, the information is only exposed in a small fraction of time when it is used, remaining secured during the rest of the time, even when the system is powered off.",Main
"Experiments were conducted to assess the feasibility of the proposed cell. The RRAM devices used in the experiments are TiN/Ti/HfO2/W structures [20,38]. Figure 8a shows a schematic cross-section of the final device structure. A top view optical microscope image of the structures is illustrated in Figure 8b, which are square cells of 60  60 m2, 15  15 m2 and 5  5 m2. The electrical characterization of the devices was performed using two synchronized B2912A precision source/measure units (SMUs, Keysight, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). The typical resistive switching characteristics under DC conditions are shown in Figure 9a, where double-sweep voltage ramps were applied from 0 V to +1.1 V for the SET, and from 0 V to ??1.4 V for the RESET operations. The corresponding cycling behavior under the pulse mode, using the same voltage amplitudes as those in DC conditions, is presented in Figure 9b.",Main
"The pulse mode was assessed and before checking the functionality as a memory cell, an initial experiment was performed to reproduce the results in [38]. It consisted in starting from both devices in the LRS, applying a sequence of unmasking-masking operations (both followed by a read operation) without forcing a write operation in advance, as illustrated in Figure 10. Which of the devices is going to switch after the first unmasking operation is unpredictable, but for subsequent masking/unmasking operations, the switching device is expected to be the same. Depending on which of the RRAMs switches to the HRS two different states of the cell (¡®0¡¯ or ¡®1¡¯) can be differentiated, as previously presented in Figure 4a,b. Experimental results for a serial cell are shown in Figure 11a,b, which were derived from the read operations after masking and unmasking, respectively. In this example, Rbottom switches to the HRS, whereas Rtop remains at the LRS. Considering the results in Figure 11b, and according to the definitions in Figure 4, ¡®1¡¯ was stored in this example. However, Figure 11a shows that the bit (¡®1¡¯ in this particular example) is masked after a SSET since both devices remain in the LRS. The RRAM that goes first to the HRS depends on the LRS resistance and the RESET voltage of the devices in every particular cell. This persistent behavior is mainly due to the higher inter-device variability as compared to the intra-device variability, as shown in Figure 12a for the RESET voltage (VRESET) and in Figure 12b for the resistance in the LRS (RLRS). The data was derived from 25 DC cycles of 15 different devices.",Main
"The experimental set-up was subsequently upgraded in order to check the functionality of secure NVMs, including the ability to control which of the two RRAMs switches to the HRS. The corresponding results are presented in the next section. Experiments were conducted on a set of RRAM pairs to validate the operation of the cell. The amplitude of the pulses applied during the experiments is summarized in Table 1. It must be taken into account that VSSET and VSRESET are slightly higher than the values corresponding to causing the SET and RESET of a single device, but they are low enough to avoid the degradation of the devices.",Main
"The only difference is that we included an extra read operation to check the state of the cell after masking, which would not be required in normal operation mode. Hence, starting from both devices in the LRS, a write-0 operation was applied, followed by a sequence of 1000 unmasking-read-masking-read operations. The equivalent experiment was also conducted with an initial write-1 operation. The voltage measured at the common terminal of the two devices (Vap2) during the SREAD operation is shown in Figure 13a,b after an unmasking and masking operation, respectively. It is observed that the stored bit can be unmasked and masked 1000 times. After unmasking, the measured voltage is close to 0 V when ¡®0¡¯ was initially written to the cell. On the contrary, the measured voltage was close to 0.2 V (VSREAD) when ¡®1¡¯ was initially written in the cell. However, an intermediate voltage was measured after masking regardless of the initial written value. In fact, the two sets of voltage measurements are overlapped. Thus, it is unlikely to predict whether ¡®0¡¯ or ¡®1¡¯ is stored under the masked state.",Main
"The resistances of the devices derived from the results in Figure 13 are represented in Figure 14. After the unmasking operation (Figure 14a) both devices are in different resistance states, depending on which value was written to the cell in advance. However, once masked, both devices remain in the LRS. The resistance values are quite similar regardless of the value initially stored in the cell, as observed in Figure 14b. Therefore, these results demonstrate that we can deterministically determine the switching RRAM of the cell, i.e., writing the desired data to the cell (0 or 1), and we can subsequently mask and unmask the previous written data repeatedly.",Main
"Experiments were also conducted to check the behavior of the masked bit over time. In particular, the goal consisted in extending the masked state for 104 s, verifying throughout the experiment that it was stored (masked) successfully. The corresponding results showing the resistance values of the RRAMs are shown in Figure 15a,b when ¡®0¡¯ was initially written to the cell. The equivalent values are presented in Figure 16a,b when ¡®1¡¯ was initially written to the cell. The results confirm that the bit can be unmasked and masked for at least 104 s.",Main
"The resistances of the two devices are derived from the read operations after unmasking (Figure 17a) and masking (Figure 17b). The switching device is always the expected RRAM, according to the value written to the cell. Furthermore, the resistances in the LRS of the two RRAMs are very similar in the masked state regardless of the previous write operation. In fact, the two sets of points overlap, as observed in Figure 17b. This feature, which allows rewriting the cell many times, confirm the use of this cell as a memory cell. In fact, it can also be exploited for reconfiguration purposes or the removal of the information stored in the cell in those applications where the information is rarely updated. In fact, these results, together with the capability of masking and unmasking the data, confirm the suitability of this cell for application in secure NVMs.",Main
"The present work proposes the novel use of the serial configuration of two RRAMs as a memory cell with the extra capability of data masking. This serial cell presents three states: ¡®1¡¯, ¡®0¡¯ and masked. In the masked state, both RRAMs remain in the LRS, improving the data protection against physical attacks when the device is powered off. Furthermore, the symmetry of the cell¡¯s operation complicates the information stealing by monitoring the current consumption of the cells. Experimental work has been conducted on RRAMs devices where the functionality of the serial cell is confirmed. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this cell provides the permission of rewriting or updating its content, which can be useful for reconfiguration purposes. These experimental results are a proof of concept that demonstrates the applicability of this design for secure NVMs. An array configuration has also been proposed based on the serial RRAM cell, which can be leveraged to derive a secure NVM. It has been shown how this array self-shields each cell against reverse engineering techniques and provides robustness against side-channel attacks, which paves the way to the application of RRAMs for secure NVMs. However, a physical implementation of the proposed serial RRAM cell array was not achieved, as well as the security performance experiment with all the existing attacking methods, both of which are expected in our future work.",Summary

"A novel reconfigurable architecture, rFPGA, is developed by utilising high-density resistive memory (RRAM) circuits as FPGA components. Different from the existing CMOS-nano hybrid FPGAs that use crossbars, the rFPGA mainly consists of 1T1R RRAM structures (one CMOS transistor is integrated with a two-terminal resistive nanojunction) that can be fabricated using an efficient CMOS-compatible process. These 1T1R structures can significantly improve the FPGA memory and routing circuits, and enable the rFPGA to achieve at least a 2 density enhancement along with a 10% reduction of delay and power, compared with the corresponding CMOS FPGA.",Abstract
"FPGA chips have applications across the entire spectrum of electronic system design, in particular for prototype development. The FPGA¡¯s properties, such as reconfiguration and defect tolerance, are attractive to the electronic industry, especially when CMOS technology scales down to nanometre range and the fabrication yield of IC components hardly ever approaches 100%. It is predicted that the worldwide FPGA market will increase from $1.9 billion in 2005 to $2.75 billion by 2010 [1]. Much of this revenue comes from the significant increase of high-end FPGA chips with a large amount of memory components.",Introduction
"As shown in Fig. 1, a baseline FPGA consists of a switch block (SB), a connection block (CB) and a logic block (LB). The routing resources include SBs, CBs, configuration memories and interconnects, which account for around 80% of the total area, delay and power of the FPGA [2]. Thus it is critical to enhance the performance of these programmable routing elements as well as the additional block memory units in the high-end FPGA.",Introduction
"In this Letter, we propose to utilise resistive memory (RRAM) circuits to build FPGA routing resources and block memories. This leads to a novel CMOS-nano hybrid FPGA architecture, rFPGA, which consists of large arrays of 1T1R devices (one CMOS transistor is integrated with a two-terminal resistive nanojunction). 1T1R structures naturally integrate nanodevices with CMOS devices, which can solve the integration challenge of CMOS-nano hybrid circuits [3 ? 5]. Previously, 1T1R devices were mainly proposed for memory applications [6? 14]. The novelty of this research is to explore the use of 1T1R structures as FPGA routing logic circuits and block memories. To the knowledge of the authors, this work is the first effort to use 1T1R structures for FPGA applications.",Introduction
"1T1R consists of a CMOS transistor (1T) and a bistable junction nanodevice (1R). The nanojunction device is generally a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure that exhibits hysteretic characteristics or a reproducible switching between two resistance states: state 1 of low resistance and state 0 of high resistance (Figs. 2a and 2b). These resistive (Fig. 2a) or diode-like (Fig. 2b) junction devices can be used to build 1T1R or crossbar structures. Note that according to recent studies [7 ? 14], the resistive junction (Fig. 2a) has more material choices than the diode-like junction (Fig. 2b). Thus we consider resistive junctions in this study",Main
"In the crossbar structure, the nanojunctions are at the crosspoints of the nanowire array, leading to a high-density memory architecture. The nanojunction-based crossbar can also be integrated with CMOS devices to build CMOSnano FPGAs such as: CMOL [3], FPNI [4], nFPGA [5] and nanoPLA [15]. The main challenge of these crossbarbased FPGAs is that the integration of crossbars and CMOS devices is not easily established [4, 5]. In particular, it is difficult to obtain special metal pins to connect CMOS transistors with the top or bottom nanowires, respectively [3 ? 5]. This motivates us to consider 1T1R devices that allow an efficient integration of junction devices with CMOS devices [6 ? 14] to build the FPGA.",Main
"In the 1T1R structure, the resistive junction is integrated on top of the source or drain terminal of a transistor (Fig. 2c). The transistor is used to write and read the resistance state of the MIM structure, establishing memory operations. The fabrication of these 1T1R nanodevices is efficient and CMOS compatible. Even though the reproducible RRAM cells and circuits have not yet been established, several promising prototypes have been demonstrated by several RRAM research groups and companies [6?14]. The novelty of this work is to extend the use of 1T1R devices and RRAM circuits to FPGA programming logics and block memories.",Main
"An rFPGA maintains the architecture of the baseline FPGA (Fig. 1) while utilising RRAM circuits to efficiently build several FPGA components. In particular, the SRAM-based block memory is replaced by RRAM to achieve high density. New SB and CB designs are developed using RRAM circuits. Note that the LB is still the traditional CMOS LB",Main
"In an rFPGA, the NOR RRAM circuit is used to build block memories instead of the NAND RRAM. The layouts of NOR and NAND RRAM cells are given in Fig. 3. Both cells require metal contacts to locate nanojunctions and their cell sizes are similar: 10F2 (F is the half pitch of a transistor). It is well known that the NAND circuit requires slow serial access and the NOR circuit provides fast random access. Thus by considering both cell size and speed of performance, the NOR-type always has a better performance than the NAND-type in RRAM designs and is selected for the rFPGA block memory application.",Main
"Note that this comparison of NOR and NAND RRAM circuits is different from that of the corresponding flash circuits. For flash memory circuits based on floating gate transistors, the NAND-type circuit is area efficient (cell size is 4F2 ), since the adjacent cells share the metal contact. However, each NAND RRAM cell requires a separate metal contact to support a resistive nanojunction and cannot share contacts to achieve high density. Thus NAND RRAM has a similar density as NOR RRAM. The high-speed property of NOR RRAM always makes it superior to NAND RRAM.",Main
"By using high-density block memory based on the NOR RRAM, we can either increase the block memory capacity for the same chip area or design the same amount of block memories using a smaller chip area. Here we use the latter approach so that other building blocks of the FPGA can still operate with the same amount of block memories. Note that the Xilinx block RAM memory ranges from 4 to 18 K [1]. Thus the RRAM arrays in an rFPGA will also range from 4 to 18 K, with a reduced chip area.",Main
"The ¡®write¡¯ and ¡®read¡¯ IO circuit is required by each block memory to communicate with its corresponding CB. The IO circuit of the RRAM block memory is designed to drive (write) and sense (read) currents of the NOR RRAM [15], which is different from the SRAM IO circuit of the baseline FPGA.",Main
"The proposed rFPGA includes new CB designs to utilise RRAM components. The LBs and memory blocks connect to the routing channels through CBs. The existing 4-to-4 CMOS CB is shown in Fig. 4a [2]. Instead of using a sixtransistor SRAM to program the pass transistor as shown in Fig. 4b, we propose to use two programming transistors to configure an 1R junction at the connection point (Fig. 4c). During the configuration stage we select the two transistors to program the 1R junction to be RON or ROFF. If the 1R junction is RON, it will turn on the connection point during the operation stage. If the 1R junction is ROFF, it will disconnect the connection point.",Main
"An rFPGA consists of new SB designs based on RRAM or 1T1R structures. The CB will connect to the SB to establish global routing. Designs of SBs can use pass transistors or multiplexers. The pass transistor-based designs [2] are generally used in modern FPGAs and are considered here. The two typical designs of such SBs [2], namely SB-1 and SB-2, are shown in Figs. 5a and 5c.",Main
"By using the RRAM component or the 2T1R structure (Fig. 4c) as the connection point, we can obtain RRAMbased designs for SB-1 and SB-2 in Figs. 5b and 5d, respectively. In the RRAM SB-1 design (Fig. 5b, showing only one out of the four branches) the 2T1R connection points are used and the tristate buffers have been redesigned. The RRAM SB-2 design (Fig. 5d, showing only one out of the four branches) is based on the 2T1R connection points and CMOS buffers without using the tristate buffers.",Main
"In the baseline CMOS FPGA [1], the interconnects between two adjacent SBs are local interconnects. Additional HEX lines are used to connect two SBs of a long distance (a typical distance of six SBs) to provide a fast and direct connection. Our proposed SB designs can also have these interconnects, maintaining the interconnect structures of the baseline FPGA [1].",Main
"To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed rFPGA, its performance is compared with that of the corresponding CMOS FPGA [1, 2] in terms of area, delay and power.",Main
"Based on the above analysis, we simulate the rFPGA performance for Toronto 20 FPGA benchmarks and show the results in Table 3. The simulation results demonstrate that the rFPGA provides 2-3 improvement over the baseline FPGA in terms of area. The improvement in terms of delay and power is around 10%",Main
"The simulation is based on CMOS 32 nm technology and uses FPGA CAD tools, following the methods used in [5]. The rFPGA maintains the architecture of the CMOS FPGA. Thus its design and simulation can utilise CMOS FPGA CAD tools such as VPR (delay analysis) and fpgaEva_LP2 (power analysis). To accommodate RRAM circuits in VPR, the models of junction nanodevices are generated using Verilog-A and incorporated into the VPR CAD flow. Note that Toronto 20 benchmark circuits do not consider block memories. Thus the comparison in Table 3 considers only SBs, CBs and LBs, not block memories. The comparison of block memories of the rFPGA and the CMOS FPGA is described in Table 3.",Main
"This work presents a novel method to build an FPGA using RRAM circuits. The main advantages are: ¢Ó 1T1R-based RRAM circuits are CMOS-compatible and naturally integrated with CMOS circuits. ¢Ó RRAM-based CBs and SBs can significantly simplify FPGA routing resources, leading to 2-3 density improvement. ¢Ó RRAM-based block memories have 6 complexity reduction compared with the CMOS block memories. ¢Ó RRAM-based rFPGA maintains the SB-CB-LB architecture such that the existing FPGA circuit designs and CAD tools can be utilised.

"The probabilistic switching of resistive random access memory (RRAM) can be utilised to implement physical unclonable functions (PUFs). By setting the operation condition at a switching probability of 50%, devices in a RRAM array are randomly settled into state ¡®0¡¯ or ¡®1¡¯ after programming. The RRAM switching probability provides a natural source of randomness that could be exploited in the PUF to generate security primitives. The feasibility and characteristics of the proposed PUF are analysed by simulation based on measured RRAM switching probability. With good scalability and stochastic mechanisms, RRAM may prove to be a promising candidate for security applications.",Abstract
"Metal?oxide-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) has become a major candidate for emerging non-volatile memories. They can switch between a high-resistance state (HRS, or ¡®off¡¯ state) and a low-resistance state (LRS, or ¡®on¡¯ state), where both states are non-volatile. The switching from HRS to LRS is ¡®set¡¯ and that from LRS to HRS ¡®reset¡¯. RRAM has demonstrated promising scalability, especially in crossbar arrays and three-dimensional architectures. A key challenge of RRAM is the stochastic switching mechanisms related to the formation and rupture of filamentary conductive paths, which cause large variation in RRAM switching parameters. Variability degrades memory operation margins and affects the functional array design; however, a truly random variation could be exploited in security applications. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have recently emerged as a promising hardware security solution [1]. An input to a PUF device (¡®challenge¡¯) generates an output (¡®response¡¯), converting intrinsic variation in the physical device to randomness in bit strings. These challenge?response pairs (CRPs) can be utilised as security primitives. Ideally, the PUF cannot be duplicated or predicted owing to the randomness in the underlying physical systems. Most of these PUF designs are static with unalterable CRPs after the fabrication of the underlying physical systems. The so-called ¡®reconfigurable PUF¡¯ could be refreshed with updated CRPs that inherit all the original security properties. Reconfigurability of PUFs could enhance their resistance against attacks or reliability degradation [2]. This Letter proposes a reconfigurable PUF design based on the probabilistic switching of RRAM.",Introduction
"PUF based on RRAM probabilistic switching: The stochastic nature of the RRAM switching mechanisms is also reflected in its switching probability. The reset switching probability of copper oxide (CuOx)-based RRAM was measured against voltage and current compliance, which fits well with a thermally activated reset model, as shown in Fig. 1.",Introduction
"A 64 kbit array of 1-transistor-1-resistor (1T1R) RRAM cells was fabricated and the reset probability was measured in array testing. Details of the reset probability measurement and modelling can be found in [3]. Fig. 1a shows the dependence of reset probability on the voltage applied from the drain side of a 1T1R cell (Vd). The inset highlights the sensitivity of the reset probability on voltage of about 50%. The reset can also be achieved with a fixed Vd and increasing current compliance controlled by the transistor gate voltage (Vg). The reset probability against Vg is shown in Fig. 1b, with a sensitivity of about 50% enlarged in the inset.",Introduction
"This voltage-dependent switching probability provides a source of randomness for a PUF design as shown in Fig. 2. It is based on a standard 1T1R RRAM array (Fig. 2a). All the cells in the array are first set to LRS. Then, by biasing the memory cells at the voltage for 50% reset probability, every cell has equal opportunity to reset to HRS or remain in LRS. Ideally, after the reset operation, the RRAM array will have bit ¡®0¡¯ (LRS) and bit ¡®1¡¯ (HRS) randomly distributed in the array, each with 50% probability. The ¡®challenge¡¯ of this PUF is defined as the address of an n-bit memory data and the ¡®response¡¯ is the n-bit data composed of a random string of 0 and 1 s. The PUF operation is illustrated in the flowchart in Fig. 2b. The whole RRAM array can be cycled into new states to refresh the CRPs, i.e. ¡®reconfiguration¡¯ of the PUF. RRAM devices typically require a forming process after fabrication before stable set/reset operations can be achieved. Forming is usually done with higher voltage/current or slower speed than regular switching, which presents a challenge for memory design and operation. However, forming could be utilised in PUFs for tamper resistance.",Introduction
"There are a set of parameters to evaluate the performance of the PUF [4], among which the most important are uniformity, uniqueness and robustness. The uniformity of the PUF is measured by bias defined as the percentage of bit ¡®1¡¯ (¡®1¡¯-bias) or bit ¡®0¡¯ (¡®0¡¯-bias) in the response bit strings. An ideal random response should have a bias of 50%. The uniqueness represents how well a PUF device can uniquely differentiate itself from other PUF devices. It is measured by the inter-chip Hamming distance (inter-HD) defined as the HD between the responses of different PUF devices when the same challenge is applied on them. The best distinguishability between two bit strings can be achieved when on average half of the bits differ, which corresponds to an inter-HD of 50%. The robustness indicates how reliably a PUF device can generate the same response under different testing conditions for the same challenge. It is measured by the intra-chip HD (intra-HD) defined by the HD between responses measured on the same device at different times and conditions for the same challenge. The intra-HD represents noise in the response and should be minimised. Large separation between inter-HD and intra-HD reduces the false identification rate.",Main
"Assessment of robustness (i.e. intra-HD) needs to consider the temperature and voltage effects on the state of the RRAM. On the basis of the switching probability described in Fig. 1, voltage fluctuation within 0.3 V corresponds to the reset probability below 10?14 and has negligible probability to flip the state of a RRAM cell in a 256 kbit array. For RRAMs with a retention of 10 years at room temperature, the reset probability only rises to ¡­2 ¡¿ 10?7 at 400 K (127¡ÆC). As long as all the cells in the array remain in the same state without being disturbed by voltage fluctuation or temperature increase, intra-HD is essentially 0%. The low probability of disturbing the RRAM state by voltage fluctuation and temperature (within certain ranges) indicates the strong robustness of this PUF design. The ¡­15¥ò separation between inter-HD and intra-HD in this example leaves abundant allowance for possible degradation of PUF uniqueness or robustness.",Main
"The distributions of bias (uniformity) for the bit-to-bit RL from 0 to 2 ¥Ø are shown in Fig. 4. For the ideal scenario with RL = 0 ¥Ø, the bias distribution has the ¥ì value of 50% and a small ¥ò of 3.2%. With the increase of RL, the bias distributions have similar ¥ì values but larger ¥ò. The increasing spread of the bias distribution is also due to the RL-induced location-dependent reset probability. Cells away from the centre of the array are increasingly skewed towards ¡®0¡¯ or ¡®1¡¯ depending on the location. Therefore, the bias of responses from cells on different sides of the array is moving away from 50% (at the centre) in opposite directions, which increases the spread of bias distribution. The inset of Fig. 4 shows the bias of 1024 responses in one array that decreases from ¡­60% from one side of the array, through ¡­50% at the centre and down to ¡­40% on the other side.",Main
"The simulation in Fig. 4 assumes a total resistance of 1T1R cells of 10 k¥Ø in LRS. The RL-induced voltage variation depends on the relative magnitude of RL in comparison with R1T1R. When RRAM devices with higher resistance are used in the PUF array, the relative impact of RL is reduced. With R1T1R of 20 k¥Ø, the increase of ¥ò(bias) with RL is significantly suppressed. Higher R1T1R will also reduce the degradation of inter-HD by RL. Overall, it is desirable to utilise RRAM devices with higher resistance in the PUF design to reduce the impact of RL.",Main
"So far, the simulation of the impact of voltage variation has only considered the effect of RL. RRAM is well known to exhibit large variation in their resistance, which could introduce more voltage variation from device to device. For simplicity, the impact of resistance variation is not included in this simulation. It should also be emphasised that the reset probabilities in Fig. 1 were measured in fabricated RRAM arrays with both line resistance and device-to-device resistance variation. In other words, the reset probability characteristics where the PUF is based on already factor in some effects of RL and resistance variation. Therefore, the actual degradation of inter-HD and bias could be less severe than the simulation results based on the simplified treatment of RL-induced voltage variation shown in this Letter. In principle, the RL-effect could also be compensated by modulating Vdd while programming cells at different locations in the array. However, fine-tuning of Vdd may be challenging and also incur an operation overhead.",Main
"A reconfigurable PUF is proposed based on the probabilistic switching characteristics of RRAM. With a quantitative model of reset switching probability based on measurement in an RRAM array, the key parameters of the proposed PUF are assessed by simulation. Its feasibility is demonstrated by the large separation between inter-HD and intra-HD, as well as good uniformity. Voltage variation in the array due to line resistance affects the PUF performance, which could be alleviated by employing RRAM devices with higher resistance. It should be mentioned that this probabilistic switching characteristic of RRAM may also be utilised to build random number generators.",Summary

"In this paper, the resistive switching characteristics in a Ti/HfO2 : Al/Pt sandwiched structure are investigated for gradual conductance tuning inherent functions. The variation in conductance of the device under different amplitudes and voltage pulse widths is studied. At the same time, it was found that the variation in switching parameters in resistive random-access memory (RRAM) under impulse response is impacted by the initial conductance states. The device was brought to a preset resistance value range by energizing a single voltage amplitude pulse with a different number of periodicities. This is an efficient and simple programming algorithm to simulate the strength change observed in biological synapses. It exhibited an on/off of about 100, an endurance of over 500 cycles, and a lifetime (at 85 ?C) of around 105 s. This multi-level switching two-terminal device can be used for neuromorphic applications to simulate the gradual potentiation (increasing conductance) and inhibition (decreasing conductance) in an artificial synapse.",Abstract
"Resistive switching (RS) devices were originally conceived for memory applications [1,2] because of the advantages compared to traditional charges-based memories, such as their superior speed, low operating voltage, excellent scalability [3], and non-volatile and multi-level data storage abilities [4]. Currently, multi-level resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices can be widely used for data storage [5,6], logical calculation [7,8], bionic neural network systems [9,10], and so on. They have also been studied as artificial synapses for applications in neuromorphic computation, featuring high parallelism [11?13] and the ability to perform adaptive learning [14]. RRAM devices can solve problems that the traditional Von Neumann paradigm is not able to deal with, such as incomplete defined inputs, as in real-world scenarios [15], or the implementation of adaptive learning algorithms [14].",Introduction
"Great efforts have been made to optimize both materials and programming techniques to design a device that can simulate biological synaptic behavior, i.e., gradually increase and decrease its conductance under suitable voltage excitation [13,15,16]. In order to facilitate the practical applications of multi-level RRAM devices, it is necessary to consider the materials of complementary metal oxide silicon (CMOS)-compatible devices. HfO2 is used as a high-k gate dielectric in CMOS devices because of its high reliability, fast operating speed, and low power consumption [17,18]. Currently, analog switching with multi-level states and reliability is not available for RRAM. Therefore, researchers have come up with a variety of solutions, including improving the manufacturing process (doping in the HfO2 layers [19?23], modulation of oxide/metal interfaces [9,24], post-deposition annealing [19], etc.) and optimizing the measurement conditions. For electrode materials, Hong et al. [9] suggested that the use of a combination of inert and active metals, such as Ti/Pt, could improve the reliability of the device. Traore et al. [24] found that a Ti/HfO2 interface facilitates the formation of O defects from the interface region into Ti and suggest the interface region to be the precursor for defect formation. ",Introduction
"Previous studies [20?23] have shown that the doped HfO2 RRAM devices are more likely to realize stable intermediateresistance states (IRS) together with high-resistance states (HRS) and low-resistance states (LRS) compared with pure HfO2 devices. It was attributed to controllable oxygen vacancies (Vo)-based filament formation along the Al atoms diffused into the HfO2 resistive switching film [21]. Wang et al. [4], Gao et al. [25], and Covi et al. [20] prepared multi-level RRAM by doping HfO2 with Cu, Gd, and Al, respectively. However, they can only carry out a four-level storage state [4,25]. According to Zhou et al. [26], TiN/Al2O3/HfO2/Pt bilayer RRAM devices show seven analog reset states for both current scanning and voltage scanning operations with an on/off ratio of around 10. Woo et al. [27] explained that RRAM devices with an AlOx/HfOx bi-layer structure present 12 distinct analog multi-levels with on/off ratio over 10. Moreover, the different conductance states were achieved using the application of voltage pulses with different amplitudes [12,26,28] or widths [10,13,28] or compliance currents of different flexibilities [4] during the set program process. This will increase the operational difficulty in the above applications. Few scholars have realized that the device can reach a certain conductivity range accurately through a train of identical pulses [29], which has a simple structure that facilitates a highly integrated implementation and is therefore best suited for neuromorphic applications. In addition, it was reported that the reset operation usually features a gradual change in the device conductance. The resistive switching is inherently stochastic due to the randomness of the generation and the migration of oxygen vacancy based on the Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation proposed by Yu et al. [29]. The sudden change in conductivity in the set process requires an additional current compliance [12,15,30,31] to prevent device damage, which is the problem that must be overcome to realize the above scheme.",Introduction
"In this context, an Al-doped HfO2-based memristor is presented as a suitable device for an artificial synapse. We previously studied the mechanism of multi-stage resistance of a HfO2: Al memristor [23]. This time, by studying different switching dynamics in the pulsed regime, a scheme was obtained through which the device can be stabilized to the desired conductivity range by using a series of identical pulses. Firstly, the device was obtained by cyclic growth of HfO2 and Al2O3 in a certain proportion by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor. Then, the resistive switching characteristics of the device were analyzed by direct current (DC) scanning and voltage pulses. Finally, by matching the appropriate pulse and initial conductance values, the device conductance could be gradually changed stepwise with the set pulses.",Introduction
"The samples studied here are Ti/HfO2: Al/Pt (Figure 1a) RRAM devices. Ti/Pt layers of 120 nm were successively deposited by sputtering at room temperature on a Si/SiO2 substrate. Ti acts as the adhesive layer between the bottom electrode (BE) of Pt and the substrate. After this, a 20-nm HfO2 layer was deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2-coated silicon substrates in an ALD reactor at 300 ?C [32]. Al-doped films were obtained by depositing one cycle of Al2O3 for every 33 cycles of HfO2. The thicknesses of the thin films were measured using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam Co.SE M2000U, Lincoln, NE, USA), and the measured result was about 19.73 nm. Finally, a Ti layer of 50 nm acting as a top electrode (TE) and a Pt layer of 100 nm acting as covering layers were deposited by DC sputtering and patterned to form a 100 ?m ¡¿ 100 ?m isolated square (Figure 1b). The Al atomic concentration was 1.81%. According to the chemical binding energy analysis of the film by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the Theta 300 XPS system, the atomic concentration of Al was 1.81%. Figure 1c,d show the spectra of Al-doped and non-doped devices. The spectra were calibrated by C 1 s (284.6 eV) peak. For the HfO2 film, the peak of Hf 4f can be fitted as a double peak. Through fitting, it can be seen that the ratio of Hf 4f5/2 to Hf 4f7/2 increased for the doped devices. Moreover, Al-doped devices show the shift of the Hf 4f peak to the higher binding energy and a distinct 74.3 eV peak of Al 2p.",Methods
"Electricalmeasurements were performed using Agilent B1500A (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The Source Measurement Unit (SMU) was used to perform the DC sweeps, and the Waveform Generator/FastMeasurement Unit (WGFMU) was used to perform pulse signals generation and measurement. The signal needle of the two modules contacted the TE of the device simultaneously, and the working module was selected at the operation interface of the testing equipment [25]. Then, the selected module generated corresponding electrical signals that were applied to the device. The bottom electrode was always grounded.",Methods
"Figure 2 shows typical DC I-V bipolar switching curves of Al-doped HfO2-based RRAM devices. In the set/reset process, multi-stage conductance was obtained by changing the compliance current and the stop voltage, respectively. It was found that both the set (off-to-on transition) process and the reset (on-to-off transition) process are gradual. This is because Al dopants reduce the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (Vo) and Vo are formed scattered near the dopants [33]. Therefore, multiple filaments are formed in the set process based on the uniform distributed Vo in the oxide layer [9,21,34]. It can also be seen that the set voltage increases obviously with the increase in the reset stop voltage. It shows that with the increase in the reset stop voltage, the more oxygen vacancies in the oxide layer are consumed, the more serious the damage to the conductive filaments. At this point, the set process requires a larger forward voltage to reform the conductive filaments in the oxide layer. In contrast, the reset voltage does not obviously change with the increase in the set limiting current. In the reset process, regardless of the original resistance, the conductive filament will break when the reverse voltage applied to the TE of the device reaches a certain value. This shows that the difference in conductive filaments in different low-resistance states is not due to the thickness of filaments, but the number of filaments [21,35].",Main
"Figure 2c shows the DC I-V characteristic curve during gradually increasing compliance current in the set process. It can be seen that the device has excellent resistance retention characteristics in the set process and the resistance changes gradually. Combined with Figure 2a, the resistance of device after the set process of the DC sweep is mainly determined by the compliance current. The multi-step switching effect is demonstrated by increasing the current compliance step by step [36]. The Vo generated by the reapplied positive bias voltage forms more conductive filaments as the limiting current increases. Therefore, the set process may present as a gradual change in resistance. Figure 2d shows the DC I-V curve for the first 256 cycles of the device. It can be seen that the set/reset voltage barely changed, whereas the switching window is slightly reduced. This shows the excellent cyclic repeatability of the device.",Main
"Currently, we turn our attention toward the impulse response of the devices using WGFMU, which is the central exploration of this work. First, the device was set and reset using a square-waveform voltage pulse with a width of 100 s. Figure 3 shows the resistance window (HRS/LRS for set is Rinitial/Rafter, and for reset is Rafter/Rinitial) variation by applying a single voltage pulse of different amplitudes to a device with the same initial resistance. It can be seen from the figure that when the pulse width is constant, the increase in the voltage amplitude will cause a great variation in the conductance [28]. Both set and reset have a threshold bias level of around Vth ~ 0.45 V and Vth ~ ??0.6 V, respectively. When the set voltage reaches 0.6 V, it is limited by current limitation, and the change of resistance is no longer obvious.",Main
"The typical dynamic current responses of the voltage pulse are shown in Figure 4. According to the reset process, it can be seen from Figure 4b that the response current of the device suddenly decreases under the impulse voltage. The results of the same reset voltage pulse applied in different resistance states of devices are also compared in the figure. The original resistance state of the device cannot change the mutation of the reset process, but only the time of the reset process. Combined with the above DC characteristics, it is shown that the thickness of several conductive filaments in the oxide layer is the same, and the fracture occurs simultaneously in the reset process. The gradual change in the conductance value during the reset process in the DC sweep is because the bias value applied to the device increases point by point. Multiple conductive filaments will gradually break from various relatively thin places until all the conductive filaments are broken. The conductance modulation of the reset process is suitable for applying voltage pulses with different amplitudes.",Main
"Compared to the reset process, the multi-stage set process is easier to implement. It can be observed from Figure 4a that the transient current of the device increases gradually under continuous constant voltage. This indicates that the change in resistance of the device during the set process is gradual. This, in combination with Figure 2a above, led to the conclusion that the resistance change process is the process through which the conductive filaments are formed in the oxide layer one by one. With the gradual switch performance of the memory unit, multi-bit data storage can be easily implemented under an optimized switching operation scheme. Thus, we utilized the gradual set process to obtain multi-stage resistance states.",Main
"According to Figure 4a, the current of the set voltage at 0.55 V, 0.6 V, and 0.65 V are all gradients. However, the trends of the current curve are significantly different. According to Figure 3, the larger the set voltage, the larger the resistance window. However, it can be found from Figure 4a that the trend of current change is too fast under an excessive set voltage, which is not conducive to the multi-resistance state. Combining Figures 3 and 4a, when the set voltage is 0.6 V, there is a sufficiently large resistance change window, and the changing trend of current is balanced throughout the set process, which is the most suitable set pulse voltage.",Main
"Then, the excitation pulse width was reduced properly. Figure 5 shows the typical dynamic current response of a 0.6 V amplitude, 10 s pulse width, and square-waveform voltage pulse. It can be seen that different initial resistance values have a large influence on the change in resistance values in the set process [37]. The three HRS listed in figure correspond to the reset stop voltages of ??0.9 V (black), ??1.0 V (red), and ??1.1 V (blue). When the initial resistance is larger, the conductance changes more sharply. This may be the result of the complete destruction of the conducting filaments of the device under the extremely low conductivity [30,38]. This makes the oxygen vacancy more disorganized in the oxide layer. The oxygen vacancy concentration is very high in the local part of the filament structure, which is composed of oxygen vacancies. In the case of equivalent oxygen vacancies, at this point, the distribution of oxygen vacancies throughout the dielectric layer is more uniform than when the partially conducting filament is maintained. The oxygen vacancy concentration in the outer space of the conductive filament in the dielectric layer is much lower than in the higher conductivity state, in which the oxygen vacancy is more disordered. According to the transport model, when the applied electric field intensity is the same, the greater the concentration of ions, the greater the transport flux. Under the excitation of the set pulse, the oxygen vacancy can be recombined more quickly to form conductive filaments that are different from those before the reset process. When the device is in a high configuration, in which the conductive filament has just broken, the conductive filament retains its integrity except for the broken parts. During the set process, the conductive filaments are restored one by one at the break to form the original conductive filament.",Main
"Therefore, it is particularly important to select and fix the resistance state before applying the pulse in order to obtain a specific stable resistance value in the set process. When the pulse width is 10 s, the dynamic current of the device reaches saturation at about 30?50 pulse periods. This is not conducive to obtaining more different specific resistance values. It is necessary to further reduce the pulse width in the set process.",Main
"Finally, we chose the square-waveform voltage pulse signal with a width of 1 s and an amplitude of 0.6 V as the set pulse. One cycle included 400 consecutive set pulses. To stabilize the initial resistance value in a certain range before the set process, the DC sweep was adopted to complete the reset process of the device. The reset stop voltage was set to ??0.9 V. Device conductance is shown as a function of the applied voltage pulse number for ON switching (from HRS to LRS), as shown in Figure 6a. The conductance was measured at 0.1 V after each pulse. The set training process at several milestone cycles in the endurance test is also shown. No significant degradation was found after 500 cycles. Figure 6b shows the box-plot of the conductance of the device at different pulse periods for 100 different devices. After selecting 12 nodes in the set process of 400 pulses, the increment necessary for the pulse period to reach the next resistance state increases. It can be found that under the first 50 set pulses, the conductance of the device is less uniform, and then tends to be concentrated. Although the upper and lower limits of the conductance of each node overlapped partially, the interquartile ranges did not coincide. The set pulse with only a single voltage amplitude was realized to set the device in more than a dozen different resistance states.",Main
"For the data retention characteristic, 12 devices were set to preset conductance by respectively applying 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 70, 110, 160, 220, 300, and 400 set pulses and were kept at 85 ¡ÆC [39]. Figure 7 shows the retention test of all levels for resistance at 85 ¡ÆC. The conductance was read every hour with a voltage of 0.1 V. It can be seen that the resistance values of all states were stable and remained unchanged after around 105 s.",Main
The HfO2: Al RRAM devices proposed in this paper demonstrated a stable resistance state set/reset performance under DC sweep and gradual set resistance state performance under consecutive voltage pulses. It was found that the conductivity of the devices at high conductivity depends more on the number of conductive filaments than their thickness. The device can stably reach the preset resistance value by applying the same number of pulses in the setting process. Using a single voltage amplitude of pulse throughout the multi-stage resistance adjustment process can simplify the later storage system. These novel devices can be used for realizing complex logic functions. No data were lost over the course of more than a day at 85 C. The Ti/HfO2: Al/Pt device is a good potential candidate for multi-level storage.,Summary

"Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a strong candidate for next-generation memory. Despite its versatility, the sneak path current severely threatens accurate read operations, preventing RRAM from being expanded to high density array. To solve this sneak path current, here we propose a method to enhance a rectification effect through barrier height engineering. We fabricated two TiOx-based devices, Al/TiOx/Al devices as a control group and Cu/TiOx/Al devices as an experimental group, and compare their rectification characteristics. As a result, a rectification ratio in Cu/TiOx/Al devices is much larger than that of Al/TiOx/Al devices, e.g., approximately 122 times for low-resistance-state and 251 times for high-resistance-state. Furthermore, we analyze the energy band diagram considering the bias polarity and electric-field-driven oxygen ion migration. It is confirmed that the rectification effect results from high energy barrier height between Cu top electrode and TiOx. In addition, it is established that the high rectification ratio of Cu/TiOx/Al devices is capable of constructing large-sized memory array with reliable read margin by simply adjusting energy barrier height",Abstract
"Memory technology becomes more significant with the development of internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data technologies. NAND Flash has been widely used in the non-volatile memory market due to its multi-bit capacity and with obvious and reliable operation mechanisms [1,2]. However, NAND flash encounters scaling limitation in the horizontal direction, and 3D NAND vertical stacking techniques have been developed. Due to the difficulty of suitable etch and deposition processes for stacking multiple layers, there is also a limit to expansion in the vertical direction [3,4]. To overcome these limitations, several next-generation non-volatile memories such as resistive random access memory (RRAM) [5], phase-change RAM (PRAM) [6], and spin-transfer-torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) [7] have been proposed. Among them, RRAM has undergone intensive investigation for non-volatile memories, as well as synaptic devices due to its simple structure, fast speed, scalability of 4F2 , and multi-level possibilities [5,8]. In addition, RRAM has the advantage in usability to various fields due to its extensive flexibility in adopting electrode and resistive switching materials. For example, various metallic materials such as TiN, Pt, and doped?silicon for electrodes, and transition metal oxide such as TiOx, HfOx, and AlOx for resistive switching materials can be applied [9]",Introduction
"Despite the versatile advantages, sneak path current is one of the most critical problems that restrict the maximum possible size of a RRAM crossbar array [10]. When the RRAM is configured as a passive crossbar array, current flows through unselected or half-selected cells, causing inaccurate read operation [10,11]. Various methods have been explored to improve sneak path problems: integrating RRAM with diodes [12,13]; transistors [11,14?16]; or highly-nonlinear selector devices [17?20], or nonlinearity improvement by carrying out heat treatment or inserting a layer to RRAM stack or [21?23].",Introduction
"However, integrating those nonlinear devices such as diodes, transistors, or selectors limits scaling the effective cell area. RRAM, especially for filamentary-type, requires the large current of 100 ¥ìA even to 1 mA for the resistive switching process regardless of the device size: the resistance of filamentary-type devices typically does not decrease corresponding to device area scaling [24]. However, unlike filamentary RRAM, the current of nonlinear devices tends to be proportional to the device area: current densities are usually considered for the nonlinear devices. Thus, cell area of nonlinear devices cannot be not scaled down in order to satisfy the RRAM switching current. In addition, integrating additional devices complicates the manufacturing process and requires more cost. Furthermore, nonlinearity improvement by annealing or inserting an additional layer cannot be universally applied to all mate rial combinations of RRAM, so this type of approaches must be carefully selected considering each RRAM stack.",Introduction
"In this paper, we explore the method to increase the nonlinearity of RRAM with Al/TiOx/Al stack, which has presented reliable switching characteristics for memory applications and gradual resistive switching for synaptic devices as well [25?27]. We fabricated two TiOx-based RRAM devices with different top electrode materials, Al and Cu, and present rectification properties through the interface engineering between the top electrode and the switching layer. We also measured electrical properties of two devices and verify the sneak path current can be effectively reduced without integrating additional devices or inserting additional selection layers. Based on the measurement data, we analyze the rectification effects on read margin by array simulation, and validate suitability of TiOx-based RRAM as a multi-level memory or a synaptic device.",Introduction
"Fig. 1 shows a schematic drawing (Fig. 1a) and a process flow (Fig. 1b) of the fabricated TiOx-based RRAM with two different top electrode (TE) materials, Al and Cu. Hereinafter these two devices will be called ¡®Al TE device¡¯ and ¡®Cu TE device¡¯, respectively. The devices were fabricated as follows: First, 100-nm-thick Al as a bottom electrode and 60-nm-thick TiOx as a resistive switching layer were sequentially deposited on the thermally oxidized SiO2/Si substrate by DC sputtering and RF reactive sputtering, respectively. The top electrodes, Al and Cu were deposited by thermal evaporation and patterned by using a metal hard mask. After the device was fabricated, the TiOx surface was scratched, and then silver paste was applied to access the Al bottom electrode. Cross-sectional TEM images of the fabricated devices are shown in Fig. 2a (Al TE device) and Fig. 2b (Cu TE device). ",Methods
"The inset graph of Fig. 2b shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of Ti 2p3/2 in TiOx film. It is confirmed that the peaks are widely distributed. Ti4+, Ti3+ and Ti2+ components are all detected, while Ti0 component does not show noticeable intensity. This result means that the deposited TiOx film is intrinsically not stoichiometric, and suggests that there are defects such as oxygen vacancies. Titanium oxide would be stoichiometric, e.g., anatase- or rutile-phase TiO2, if synthesized by solution with annealing process [28] or deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques [29]. For this stoichiometric TiO2 with a small number of defects, the XPS spectra exhibit clear Ti4+ peaks (458.8 eV for 2p3/2 and 464.5 eV for 2p1/2) [28,29]. To further confirm elemental distribution of both Al and Cu TE devices, an energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping analysis was performed as shown in Figs. 2c and d. It can be seen that Ti and O elements are located between the top electrode and the bottom electrode, constructing TiOx. DC I-V characteristics of the fabricated devices were measured by Keithley 4200 to analyze the effect of top electrode materials on rectification ratio. Here, Al bottom electrode was grounded, and positive and negative voltages were applied to the top electrode. The rectification ratio is defined as |Ipos/Ineg|, which is the absolute value of the readout current at +1 V (positive) over that at ? 1 V (negative).",Methods
"The measured DC I-V characteristics of the Al and Cu TE devices are shown in Fig. 3a. The result of the Al TE device is described in a green dashed line, and that of the Cu TE device in a blue solid line. Both devices were activated without forming process, i.e., forming-free devices. Al TE device was swept to ? 3 V/3 V, and the Cu TE device to 5 V/? 3 V for set/reset operation, respectively. Both devices show bipolar and gradual set/reset switching characteristics. The Al TE device shows similar switching properties with the previously presented devices in [25,26]. The main difference in I-V curves of the two devices is their symmetry. The Al TE device exhibits similar current level in both the low-resistance-state (LRS) and the high-resistance-state (HRS) regardless of voltage polarity, whereas the Cu TE device shows much higher current level in the negative voltage regime compared to that in the positive voltage regime. In the case of the Al TE device, the rectification ratios of LRS and HRS are 1.52 and 0.52, respectively. On the other hand, for the Cu TE device, the rectification ratios of LRS and HRS greatly increase to 381.71 and 63.78, respectively, due to much current suppression at the positive voltage regime. These rectification ratio results are summarized in Fig. 3b. Figs. 3c and d show cycle-to-cycle resistance variation for Cu and Al TE devices, respectively. HRS and LRS currents are represented by rectangular and circle symbols, respectively. The read current values at 1 V are displayed for both HRS and LRS. Means of HRS and LRS currents for the Cu TE device are 4.31 ¥ìA and 32.1 ¥ìA, respectively, and standard deviations of those are 0.19 ¥ìA and 0.18 ¥ìA, respectively. For the Al TE devices, means of HRS and LRS currents are 0.752 mA and 3.873 mA, respectively, and standard deviations of those are 0.178 mA and 0.087 mA, respectively. Overall, it can be seen that the current of the Cu device is about 100 times lower than that of the Al device.",Main
"The rectification effect mechanism of the Cu TE device is proposed in terms of the energy band diagram in Fig. 5. Note that the conduction mechanism of the Al TE device has been already investigated [25]. Fig. 5a shows the energy band alignment of Cu, TiO2, and Al. The work functions of Cu and Al, and the electron affinity and the band gap energy (Eg) of TiO2 are specified [30,31]. Based on the energy band alignment, energy band diagrams of Cu TE devices corresponding to various bias conditions and resistance states are displayed in Figs. 4b?e. As shown in Fig. 4b, an asymmetric energy band structure is formed under no bias due to the difference between Cu (4.7 eV) and Al (4.08 eV) work functions. It can be confirmed that Schottky contact is formed at the Cu and TiO2 interface, while an Ohmic contact is formed at the TiO2 and Al interface due to the low Schottky barrier. When a negative voltage is applied to the Cu top electrode, electrons do not easily flow from Cu due to the Schottky barrier as shown in Fig. 4c, and therefore this causes the rectifying effect. On the other hand, when a positive voltage is applied to the top electrode, electrons in Al easily overcome the barrier. Figs. 4d and e describe the current flows under positive bias, when the Cu TE device is in LRS and HRS, respectively. Here, the resistance state of the Cu TE device is determined by a Ti-Al-O interfacial layer formed between TiO2 and Al. When a negative voltage is applied during reset, oxygen ions in TiO2 move toward the Al bottom electrode, forming a TiAl-O interfacial layer [25]. Since Eg of Al2O3 (7.1 eV) is much larger than that of TiO2 (3.5 eV), the Ti-Al-O layer induces larger Eg compared to TiO2 [32]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the interfacial Ti-Al-O layer results in increase in the potential barrier between TiO2 and Al.",Main
"To further analyze the conduction mechanism of the Cu TE device, current-voltage fitting was done. Fig. 5a shows the ln(I) versus sqrt(V) plot in the negative voltage regime. As a result, ln(I) and sqrt(V) show a linear relationship with a high R2 value of 0.9995. Therefore, it can be inferred that Schottky contact exists between Cu and TiO2. For the positive voltage regime, the ln(I/V) versus sqrt(V) plot fits well with a linear model (R2 = 0.9999) as shown in Fig. 5b. This result means that the TiO2-Al junction is Ohmic contact, and the current is limited by the Poole-Frenkel conduction.",Main
"The RRAM crossbar array simulation was done to demonstrate the effects of rectification properties on array applications. The Silvaco SmartSpice simulation tool was used, and the measured rectification ratios were considered. The RRAM array structure used in simulation is shown in Fig. 6. The vertical and horizontal lines of the crossbar represent word lines (WLs) and bit lines (BLs), respectively. A RRAM crossbar array consisting of N WLs and N BLs is constructed where N = 16, 64, 256. The top electrode and the bottom electrode of each RRAM cell are connected to a WL and a BL, respectively. The cell in the blue area is the selected cell to be read, which is connected between the selected WL and BL. Also, the yellow and red areas represent halfselected cells and unselected cells, respectively.",Main
"During the read operation, Vread = 1 V is applied to the selected WL and readout voltage (Vout) is calculated by voltage dividing between the selected cell resistance and the load resistance (Rload) at the end of the bit line. Grounding the unselected WLs and BLs was adopted as a read scheme, which provides sneak path current to flow into the ground rather than the selected BL and improves the sensing margin [33]. The line resistance was not considered during simulation, because the re sistivity of Al (2.65 ¡¿ 10? 8 ¥Ø?m) and Cu (1.68 ¡¿ 10? 8 ¥Ø?m) is negligibly small. In fact, if the thickness of WLs and BLs is 100 nm, the sheet resistance (Rs) is much less than 1 ¥Ø/sq., which is insignificant compared to RRAM cell resistance. This simulation also assumes the worst case where unselected and half-selected cells are in LRS. In addition, read margin is defined as the difference between Vout values when the cell is in LRS and HRS:",Main
"Figs. 7a and b shows the array simulation results based on the measured rectification ratios. Al TE and Cu TE devices are compared corresponding to their rectification effects. It was simulated for from 16 ¡¿ 16 to 256 ¡¿ 256 sized arrays, and the read margin was calculated according to the load resistance. For the Al TE device, a small maximum read margin of less than 0.1 is secured at an array size of 16 ¡¿ 16. Even worse, it can be seen that the read margin decreases drastically as the array size increases, e.g., the read margin drops to about 0.05 at 256 ¡¿ 256 size. On the other hand, for the Cu TE device, a read margin of 0.44 or more is maintained even if the array size increases to 256 ¡¿ 256. This would be attributed to much higher rectification ratio of the Cu TE device than that of the Al TE device. The maximum read margin for each array size is summarized in Fig. 7c. It can be established that the high rectification ratio translates to the reduction of sneak path current. Furthermore, this result confirms that the reliable read margin can be obtained with higher rectification ratio.",Main
"In this study, we fabricated Al/TiOx/Al and Cu/TiOx/Al devices and compare their rectification characteristics. To increase rectification ratio, copper is adopted instead of aluminum in terms of interface engineering between the top electrode and TiOx. The rectification ratio in the Cu/TiOx/Al device (381.71 for LRS and 63.78 for HRS) greatly increases compared with that in the Al/TiOx/Al device (1.52 for LRS and 0.52 for HRS). Energy band diagrams of the Cu/TiOx/Al device are investigated considering work functions of electrodes and oxygen ion migration by electric field. As a result, it is revealed that the Schottky contact in the Cu-TiO2 junction results in rectifying effect, while the TiO2-Al junction maintains low barrier height. Moreover, it is proposed that the Ti-Al-O interfacial layer formed during reset determines the resistance states in the positive voltage regime. Conduction mechanism fittings suggest that the current is limited by Schottky emission of the Cu-TiO2 junction in positive voltage regime, while limited by Poole Frenkel emission in negative voltage regime. Further, passive crossbar array is established to simulate the rectification effect on read perfor mance. Consequently, the reliable read margin over 0.44 is maintained in the Cu/TiOx/Al device. This result strongly supports that the top electrode-engineered Cu/TiOx/Al device can be constructed to the large-sized memory array.",Summary

"This study investigated the effect of resistive switching on Pt/Al2O3/Cu/Al2O3/ITO multilayer structures grown by RF/DC magnetron sputtering. A reproducible unipolar switching free forming was found only for the negative voltage. The SET and RESET processes occurred at very low voltage values, which may be advantageous for practical applications. The ON/OFF ratio was approximately five orders of magnitude for more than 103 s, which is desirable for nonvolatile memories such as resistive random-access memories (RRAMs). We explain the unipolar behavior of the characteristic (I?V) curves in terms of the formation and rupture of conductive filaments, connected via a Cu metal layer.",Abstract
"The search for efficient electronic devices has propelled the scientific research on low cost materials and materials that exhibit desirable properties. This has resulted in a reduction in the cost of electronic components and improvement in their performances. Resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices have applications in nonvolatile memory devices, and are the most promising candidates for the new generation memories, owing to their characteristics such as high processing speed, high storage density, low cost of raw materials for components, and simple structure [1?3].",Introduction
"The RRAM is based on the resistive switching phenomenon (change in the resistance of a material) of an oxide layer, usually made of transition metal oxides, such as ZrO2 [4], TiO2 [5], HfO2 [6], ZnO [7?9], BaTiO3 [10] or Al2O3 [11,18]. The device alternates in a nonvolatile manner between the high resistance state (HRS) and the low resistance state (LRS). The change from HRS to LRS is called SET (ON), and that from the LRS to HRS is called RESET (OFF). Two types of behaviors are found in resistive switching: unipolar [2], where SET and RESET occur in the same polarization; and bipolar [2], where SET occurs in one polarization and the RESET necessarily occurs in an opposite polarization. In some structures, a forming process is necessary to activate the device [12] and achieve the LRS. For this, it is necessary to apply a high voltage. Once the LRS is reached, the other switching cycles occur at lower voltages. The origin of resistive switching has been attributed mainly to the formation and rupture of conductive filaments [13] (formed by the migration of oxygen vacancies or cations) inside the film oxide. Interface effects in association with the Schottky barrier [4], and the charge trapping and detrapping model [14] are also suggested.",Introduction
"The study of multilayer devices is widely found in the literature, as reported for ZnO/Al2O3 (10 periods) [15] and HfO2/Al2O3 (19 periods) [16]. The study of a multilayer device in which a metal layer is sandwiched between two insulation layers, however, is uncommon. Guo et al. reported a bipolar behavior of resistive switching of the HfOx/Al/ HfOx [19] structure; and Song et al reported the unipolar behavior of the AlOx/Al/AlOx [17] structure.",Introduction
"In this work, we constructed a multilayer device using Al2O3/Cu/ Al2O3 that presented interesting characteristic (I?V) curves. We found a unipolar behavior under negative voltage polarization attributed to the presence of the Cu layer, which acts as a connector between the conductive filaments formed in the Al2O3 layers. In addition, the use of low-cost materials makes our device attractive for application in RRAM devices.",Introduction
"Al2O3 and Cu films were deposited at room temperature (approximately 28 ¡ÆC) by RF and DC magnetron sputtering (AJA International), respectively, in the form of an Al2O3 (13 nm)/Cu(10 nm)/Al2O3(3 nm) multilayer on an indium?tin?oxide (ITO) (Asahi Glass AGC; 100 nm)/ glass substrate. The thickness of the films was estimated via Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), not shown here. The elemental depth profile of the films was determined by RBS using a 2.2 MeV 4 He+ beam at LAMFI tandem accelerator.",Methods
"The backscattered ions were detected by a surface barrier Si detector positioned at 170¡Æ and 120¡Æ with respect to the direction of the incident ion beam. The RBS spectra were analyzed with the SIMNRA [20] and MultiSIMNRA [21] programs. Using MultiSIMNRA we obtained the final depth profile from the optimization algorithm as the model that best describes the experimental data of two detectors simultaneously. The main advantage of the selfconsistent approach is that the information contained in one spectra plays as the boundary condition during the optimization of all the others. Al2O3 (Macashew Tecnologias), with 99.99% purity, and Cu (99.99%) targets were used under Ar pressure of 7.10 mbar and power of 100 W, with deposition times of 3 h and 7 min for Al2O3 and Cu films, respectively. Structural analysis was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu K¥á (¥ë = 1.54 ?) radiation, and Al2O3, Cu, and ITO peaks were identified. The electrical properties of the multilayer Pt/Al2O3/Cu/Al2O3/ITO device were analyzed using a source meter (Keysight Agilent B2901) used for voltage applications. The I?V characteristics of the Pt/Al2O3/Cu/Al2O3/ITO device, measured by a two-point probe method, are shown in Fig. 1a; herein, the tip of Pt was estimated to have a diameter of ¡­300 ?m. In the present work, negative polarization is defined as the electric current flowing from Pt to ITO.",Methods
"The schematic representation of the structure of the Pt/Al2O3/Cu/ Al2O3/ITO device is shown in Fig. 1(a). During the switching tests, the voltage was applied to the top Pt electrode (tip) while the bottom ITO electrode remained grounded. Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD patterns of the Al2O3 and Cu films deposited on the ITO substrate. A preferred orientation (1 0 1) of Al2O3 is clearly observed, and the peaks were determined using the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD - ITO pdf number: 89-4598; Al2O3 pdf number: 42-1468; Cu pdf number: 04- 0836)",Main
"A standard sample Pt/Al2O3/ITO was produced under the same deposition conditions. No resistive switching behavior was observed. Fig. 2 shows the voltage sweep performed under negative bias with the compliance current (CC) set at 1 mA to prevent the device from burning. A SET process was obtained by sweeping the device in the direction indicated by arrow 1, where the LRS is reached at VSET ¡­ 1.6 V (arrow 2). Under a new voltage sweep (arrow 3), the device remains at the LRS until VRESET ¡­ 0.5 V (arrow 4), and the device switches to HRS.",Main
"The resistive switching behavior is free forming indicating that the Al2O3 film has a high density of oxygen vacancies [22]. The SET and RESET processes attributed to formation and rupture of a conductive filament. The RESET process occurs because of the Joule heating [23] caused by the high current density in the metallic filaments, resulting in local heating and consequently, breaking of filaments.",Main
"Fig. 3 shows the characteristic (I?V) curves of the Pt/Al2O3/Cu/ Al2O3/ITO device in which the CC values were varied to observe their influence on the resistive switching behavior. The CC values used were 1, 5, and 7 mA, and it was observed that when the CC was fixed at 7 mA, the RESET process did not occur. The increase in the CC values favors the formation of stronger filaments that support a high current density resulting in a hard breakdown (device burn).",Main
"This can also be understood to be a result of the excess oxygen vacancies in the Al2O3 film. Therefore, for smaller CC, the RESET process is achieved, and the switching cycles can be obtained several times. In the proposed device, the device underwent a hard breakdown at 7 mA; this characteristic depends on the material properties because when TiO2 was used [25], hard breakdown occurred at 22 mA.",Main
"Fig. 4 shows the characteristic curves (I?V) for 1 mA CC. Six curves (I?V) are presented and a superposition of four of these curves (corresponding to 1st, 10th, 20th and 28th switching cycles) was observed. This overlap occurred for the curves exhibiting the SET process (Fig. 4a) as well as those showing the RESET process (Fig. 4b). For the 5th and 15th switching cycles, there is a clear distinction between the VSET and VRESET values in both plots. From Fig. 4a and b, we note that for larger values of VSET, VRESET also occurred at higher values.",Main
"It is also perceptible that as the voltage sweep increased, the curves for the RESET process (Fig. 4b) exhibited fluctuations; this may indicate the effect of the Joule heating on the conducting filaments to destabilize the current, resulting in this RESET process, specifically, in the rupture of the filaments, causing the device to switch to HRS. The device showed a maximum of 28 switching cycles, indicating the possibility of application in memory devices. However, a future study will focus on improving the performance of this device.",Main
"To investigate the conduction mechanism in the Pt/Al2O3/Cu/ Al2O3/ITO device, Fig. 5 shows the (I?V) characteristics of the LRS and HRS were replotted using the double logarithmic scale. For the LRS a linear relationship (I ¡ð V) was found, which indicated that the conduction had ohmic behavior, and that it was related to the filament model. For the HRS, the conduction mechanism was governed by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model, which is described by an ohmic linear region (I ¡ð V) at low voltages and a Child¡¯s square law region (I ¡ð V2 ) at high voltages.",Main
"During the process of deposition of the films (via sputtering), there is no O2 injection, which causes defects in the films, i.e., oxygen vacancies are usually produced. In our device, such vacancies create defects in the structure of Al2O3 films and function as traps, attracting carriers that are injected during the voltage sweep. When the traps are occupied by the injected charges, the current exhibits a significant increase in the high voltage region. This results in a liquid accumulation of charge inside the material, as known from the SCLC model.",Main
"As Al2O3 films have a high density of oxygen vacancies, the standard sample (without Cu layer) displays the SET process; however, the RESET process does not occur, resulting in a hard breakdown process. The conductive filaments formed are probably very thick, thereby supporting a higher power density. This implies that a high current flows through the device, and the rupture that occurs is permanent, i.e., there is burning of the device.",Main
"Fig. 6 shows the schematic representation of the resistive switching mechanism. The Cu layer acts as a connector between the conductive filaments in the insulation layers of the Al2O3 film. The application of a voltage sweep forms conductive filaments in the Al2O3 films that connect through the metal layer of Cu. In the RESET, these filaments rupture and the current stops flowing through the device.",Main
"Fig. 7 shows the results of the retention test performed at room temperature. The time dependence of the HRS and LRS on the Pt/ Al2O3/Cu/Al2O3/ITO device was noted under a read voltage of ?0.1 V. The device presented excellent retention, with stability for more than 103 s, and there was no observed decay. The ON/OFF ratio between the LRS and HRS was approximately five orders of magnitude, indicating its potential for application in nonvolatile memory devices.",Main
"An Al2O3/Cu/Al2O3 multilayer structure was deposited on an ITO/ glass substrate to form an RRAM device, using a Pt tip as the top electrode and ITO as the bottom electrode, which was grounded. Unipolar resistive switching behavior was observed in this multilayer structure, with free forming process and the switching cycles were displayed under negative voltage bias. The SET and RESET processes",Summary
"The retention test exhibited an ON/OFF ratio of approximately five orders of magnitude, which is an excellent value, and demonstrated the applicability of our multilayer device in RRAMs. The analysis of the conduction mechanism showed ohmic conduction for the LRS and conduction of the SCLC type for the HRS. Therefore, we considered the filament model to explain the process of formation and rupture of filaments in the films of Al2O3 and, consequently, the unipolar behavior. Oxygen vacancies suggested the formation of the conductive filaments that connect through the metal layer of Cu, owing to which, the device presented the phenomenon of resistive switching. The I?V characteristics exhibited by our multilayer device indicate its potential for application in RRAM devices.",Summary

"This study presents conductance modulation in a Pt/TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN resistive memory device in the compliance region for neuromorphic system applications. First, the chemical and material characteristics of the atomic-layer-deposited films were verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling. The low-resistance state was effectively controlled by the compliance current, and the high-resistance state was adjusted by the reset stop voltage. Stable endurance and retention in bipolar resistive switching were achieved. When a compliance current of 1 mA was imposed, only gradual switching was observed in the reset process. Self-compliance was used after an abrupt set transition to achieve a gradual set process. Finally, 10 cycles of long-term potentiation and depression were obtained in the compliance current region for neuromorphic system applications.",Abstract
"Resistive switching behavior is observed in many dielectrics under an electric field [1]. The non-volatile resistance states are reversible in the high-resistance and low-resistance states. The types of switching are largely divided into unipolar and bipolar switching [2]. The memory state of the unipolar resistive switching memory can be changed by the electric stress at the same polarity. The reset process from a low-resistance state (LRS) to a highresistance state (HRS) occurs by rupture of the conducting filament by Joule heating [3]. In contrast, the set and reset processes of the bipolar resistive type occur via the opposite polarity of the electric field. Among the many resistive switching materials, metal oxides are the most popular, owing to their good stability, reproducibility, and repeatability [4?17]. Representative metal oxide-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) materials include TaOx, TiO2, Al2O3, and HfO2 [4?17], with different configurations like anodic oxidation and physical vapor deposition (PVD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). It is worth noting that a bilayer stack of metal oxide exhibits relatively better resistive switching performance, such as endurance, retention, and variability performance, compared with a single-layer stack [18?22]. In a previous study, low-power operation was achieved by controlling oxygen vacancies in the case of a HfO2/TiOx bilayer RRAM [20]. In another study, the switching uniformity was improved for a HfO2/TiO2 bilayer device owing to stabilized filament formation and rupture [21]. In the case of a double insulating layer sandwiched by electrodes with a large difference in work function, self-rectifying I?V curves have been reported, which can reduce the sneak current in the cross-point array [22].",Introduction
"Resistive switching dielectrics can be deposited by various methods, such as sputtering. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) systems have the advantages of uniform deposition, excellent step coverage, and accurate thickness control [23]. Therefore, they are suitable for a 3D vertical RRAM structure [24] as well as a conventional 2D cross-point RRAM structure.",Introduction
"Neuromorphic systems are being studied to implement a better and more efficient computing system than the existing von Neumann computing structure [25]. Neuromorphic computing enables data operation and storage to be processed as closely as possible. Parallel data processing with low energy is achieved by adopting a structure in which the RRAM element array acts as an artificial synapse [26?30]. To implement an RRAM based synaptic array in a neuromorphic system, it is important that the state of RRAM has a multi-level cell (MLC) [26?30]. Therefore, gradual change in the conductance value in an RRAM device is essential to obtain MLCs easily. Through gradual conductance changes, synaptic plasticity is imitated frequently [26?30]. To achieve a gradual change, the current of a RRAM cell should not be changed abruptly by the applied electric field. Filamentary-type resistive switching generally exhibits an abrupt transition in the set pro cess [31]. There have been reports of a gradual transition in the set process using a bilayer stack [32,33]. This gradual set process, by self-compliance, could improve the synaptic properties of a neuromorphic system. A Ti/TaOx/HfO2/Pt device exhibits gradual set and reset processes owing to the oxygen reservoir of the thin TaOx layer [32]. In addition, a Ni/SiN/Al2O3/TiN device shows gradual set and reset I?V characteristics due to the tunnel barrier of Al2O3 [33].",Introduction
"In this study, we demonstrated gradual synaptic modulation in an ALD-deposited TiO2/HfAlOx RRAM device. So far, not much has been reported about ALD-deposited TiO2-based resistive memory. In previous studies, it was found that a high-k alloy type RRAM device can adjust the dielectric band gap while controlling the composition ratio, which can tune the resistance change switching properties [11,34].",Introduction
"A Pt/TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN RRAM device was prepared as follows. A 100 nm thick TiN layer was deposited on a SiO2/Si wafer via reactive sputtering. Thereafter, a 7 nm thick HfAlOx layer was deposited by the ALD system. Tetrakis (ethylmethylamino) hafnium (TEMAH) and trimethylaluminum (TMA) were used as the metal precursors for the HfO2 and Al2O3 layers, respectively. H2O was used as the oxidant for both layers. One cycle of (TMA + H2O) deposition and 11 cycles of (TEMAH + H2O) deposition were conducted for the alloyed-type dielectric. Next, a 7 nm thick TiO2 layer was deposited using titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and H2O as reactants. Finally, a 100 nm thick Pt layer was deposited using an electron-beam evaporator via a shadow mask with circular patterns 100 ?m in diameter.",Methods
"XPS depth analysis was conducted using a Nexsa photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a microfocus monochromatic X-ray source (Al-K¥á (1486.6 eV)), a sputter source (Ar+ ), an ion energy of 2 kV, a sputter rate of 0.5 nm/s for SiO2, and a beam size of 100 ?m. The current?voltage (I?V) curves and transient curves of the RRAM cells were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS and 4225-PMU ultrafast module, Keithley Instrumnets, Cleveland, OH, USA), while a bias was applied to the Pt top electrode, and the TiN bottom electrode was grounded.",Methods
"Figure 1a shows a schematic of the Pt/TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN device. XPS analysis was performed as the X-ray was incident from the TiO2 surface, and analysis was conducted on the inner thin film through Ar+ etching. Overall, ALD-deposited film had better stoichiometry compared with films deposited by other sputtering systems [35]. Figure 1b,c shows the Ti 2p spectra for an etch time of 2 s and an etch time of 35 s, which correspond to the TiO2 layer and the TiN bottom electrode, respectively. The Ti 2p XPS spectra included Ti 2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2, as shown in Figure 1b,c. The peak binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 were located at approximately 458.94 eV and 464.5 eV for Ti-O bonds [36]. However, the peak binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 were found at approximately 454.92 eV and 460.93 eV for Ti-N bonds [37]. Figure 1d shows the Hf 4f spectra at an etch level of 9. Hf 4f7/2 and Hf 4f5/2 doublet peaks were found at 18.63 eV and 20.03 eV, respectively, for Hf-O bonds in the Hf-dominated HfAlOx film. Figure 1e shows the Al 2p spectra at an etch time of 9 s.",Main
"Figure 2a shows the I?V current characteristics, including 200 cycles of the Pt/TiO2/ HfAlOx/TiN device. It was noted that initial forming curve is similar to the subsequent I?V curve of the set process, indicating that the device can be operated with a constant set voltage without the need for an additional forming process. We used filamentary model for resistive switching here, referring to existing literature [38,39]. The set process occurred by sweeping from 0 V to ?0.7 V. An abrupt set transition was observed from the HRS to LRS, in which the decrease in resistance was due to soft breakdown in the two insulator layers. Here, a compliance current (CC) of 1 mA was used to control the conducting filament. Moreover, the oxygen vacancies in the double insulating layers were created under the applied bias [40]. It should be noted that the negative bias on the Pt/TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN device is relatively more favorable for resistive switching because the TiON interfacial layer acts as an oxygen reservoir [41]. The oxygen can easily move to the TiN layer to form TiON when a negative bias is applied on Pt. The detailed mechanisms have been discussed in previous studies [34,40,42]. The reset process was conducted to return the device to the HRS by sweeping from 0 V to 1 V. The reset process occurs because of the rupture of the conducting filament based on oxygen vacancies. The oxygen ions move from the TiON layer under a positive bias, and the recombination occurs with oxygen vacancies. Subsequently, the conducting filament can be ruptured, which indicates a decrease in conductance. Figure 2b shows up to 200 cycles, in which LRS and HRS possessed a read voltage of 0.3 V. Uniform LRS and HRS were achieved even though a small on/off ratio was observed. To increase the on/off ratio, the CC and reset stop voltages can be increased. The LRS current increased with an increase in CC, and the HRS current decreased with an increase in the reset stop voltage. An on/off ratio of 10 times or more was achieved by a CC of 10 mA and a reset sweep voltage of 2 V for 200 endurance cycles, as shown in Figure 2c. Good retention properties in the LRS and HRS were observed for 1 h (Figure 2d).",Main
"Next, we demonstrated the fine modulation of the LRS and HRS by varying the reset stop voltage. Figure 3a?c shows the I?V characteristics of the Pt/TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN device with reset stop voltages of 1.1 V, 1.2 V, and 1.3 V. Stable and uniform switching was observed for 21 cycles in each case. It can be noted that the LRS and HRS currents decreased with the increasing reset stop voltage in Figure 3d. The higher the voltage, the more the conducting filament ruptures, and thus, the HRS current decreases. It was also observed that the current gradually decreased as the reset stop voltage increased in the DC sweep mode, as shown in Figure 3e. However, MLC can be achieved by CC for the set process, which is not desirable for device control.",Main
"Next, the potentiation and depression characteristics were mimicked to apply the Pt/TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN device to a neuromorphic system. For potentiation, repetitive pulses with a voltage of ??0.8 V and a width of 1 ms were used, as shown in Figure 5. Figure S1 shows the transient characteristics of the set and reset process. A low read pulse voltage (0.3 V) was used to not affect the conductance change during the reading. It should be noted that for gradual conductance modulation in the self-compliance region, we demonstrated 10 cycles of long-term potentiation and long-term depression, and found no significant degradation of the MLC.",Main
"In this study, multilevel cells were achieved in a Pt/TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN RRAM device by gradual resistive switching in the compliance region for neuromorphic system applications. The chemical and material characteristics of the TiO2/HfAlOx/TiN stack were confirmed by XPS depth profiling. The LRS was varied by the CC at a compliance current of 1 mA, and the HRS was accurately controlled by the reset stop voltage. Repetitive endurance and stable retention characteristics were observed in different compliance current modes. The self-compliance current region was used to improve the gradual resistive switching during the set process. Finally, stable and repetitive long-term potentiation and depression were obtained owing to the gradual resistive switching in the compliance current region for neuromorphic system applications.",Summary

"The inevitable current overshoot which follows forming in filamentary RRAM devices is often perceived as a source of variability that should be minimized. This sentiment has led to efforts to curtail the overshoot by decreasing the parasitic capacitance using highly integrated 1T-1R or 1R-1R device structures. While this is readily achievable in single device test structures, it poses an intricate design constraint for memory array designs. Several papers (Degraeve et al., 2010, 2014; Fantini et al., 2013; Raghavan et al., 2013; Padovani et al., 2015) suggest that there is insufficient current to form stable filaments for small parasitic capacitances and/or low current compliance levels. Thus, the relationship between minimizing overshoot current and improved filament stability is tenuous. In this study, we utilize the forming energy-based understanding of filamentary forming to reveal that the parasitic capacitance should be optimized, rather than minimized for better filament control.",Abstract
"RRAM forming is fundamentally a dielectric breakdown process. The first step in this breakdown process is the formation of a percolation path which suddenly lowers the resistance several orders of magnitude (step A shown in Fig. 1). The as-formed percolation path (initial filament) inevitably has a current constriction point [1,2]. Next, the inrush current due to parasitic discharge (current overshoot, step B in Fig. 1) enlarges the percolation path, specifically at the point of current restriction. Then, the compliance-limited current restriction activates (step C in Fig. 1) to minimize further changes to the filament until termination of the applied voltage pulse. Using this simple forming picture, minimum variability is achieved by the combination of high initial filament resistance and highly repeatable (controlled) current responses in steps B and C. A significant difference between initial filament resistance and final resistance (Rform) minimizes the impact of the initial resistance variation on the Rform. Minimizing the parasitic capacitance (Cp) can minimize the overshoot current duration [9] (step B), thus reducing one source of variability. Careful layout considerations can limit the Cp such that the overshoot current is nearly eliminated. In this scenario, the formation of the final filament, with Rform much lower than the initial filament, relies entirely on step C [3?5]. In this study, we discuss the viability of this minimized Cp approach in which forming relies heavily on step C.",Introduction
"This study involves 5.8 nm HfO2 RRAM devices with (1T-1R) and without (1R) monolithically integrated transistor compliance elements. The details of the devices are given in Table 1. The Cp values of the devices were calculated using the 1T-1R model in [6]. The presence or absence of an additional drain pad on the integrated transistor provides a means to modulate the Cp. For all the 1T-1R measurements the transistors were operated in saturation mode. DP represents a series of (1R) devices formed using ultra-short voltage pulses ranging from 10 ns to 130 ps in width. For all devices, the energy dissipated during forming was calculated as the product of the measured current, voltage, and duration as explained in detail in [7]. All the transient and the pulsed measurements are performed by applying voltage using 50 ï¿½ï¿½ terminated input probe tip to avoid the artifacts in the input voltage measurements due to reflections. The current is then measured using the 50 ï¿½ï¿½ input impedance of a digital oscilloscope. Similar setup is described in detail in [6] and [7].",Methods
"The dielectric breakdown process (step A) is stochastic. Careful choice of the applied voltage amplitude and duration can ensure that nearly all devices undergo breakdown (forming). However, the time to breakdown, tBD, is random within the bounds of the applied voltage duration. This means that the duration of step C is intrinsically random too. Furthermore, the current level of step C is not constant. Instead, it evolves from the lower level determined by the initial filament resistance to the level set by the current limiter.",Main
"Minimizing or even eliminating step B by minimizing or nearly eliminating Cp means that the choice of a low current compliance may not allow the filament growth to reach the desired resistance stability as in the case of device D1 in Fig. 2(a). Such forming may lead to the reported insufficient current problem [3,4,8?10] and higher Rform filaments which are subject to large fluctuations which introduce further instabilities [3,4,11]. Barring changes to the materials system, efforts to combat these negative attributes involve increases to the forming voltage, pulse duration, compliance current, or some combination of all these approaches. An example for increasing current compliance to lower Rform is shown in Fig. 2(a). Devices D1 and D2 are nominally the same and each have Cp < 1 fF. Device D1 is formed using 50 ï¿½ï¿½A of current compliance which leads to a very high Rform > 1Mï¿½ï¿½ in the voltage range suitable for sensing (> 0.2 V) (Fig. 2(b)). As shown in device D2, the current compliance must be increased to above 150 ï¿½ï¿½A to achieve Rform in the range of 100 kï¿½ï¿½ (Fig. 2(b)).",Main
"Increasing the current compliance, as well as the other aforementioned tactics, all tend to increase the randomness of the filament formation process. Recently, we demonstrated that filament stability correlates with the energy dissipated during forming and that there is an optimum for stability and endurance [7]. Insufficient current is merely an indicator of insufficient dissipated energy and thus incomplete filament formation. Such filaments are more vulnerable to variation in the duration of the compliance current that flows after forming as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 illustrates the forming transients for two similar 1 T-1R devices (D3 and D4) which were formed at 5 V using the same compliance current (ï¿½ï¿½100 ï¿½ï¿½A) and have similar Cp (?1 fF). The extremely small Cp in these devices nearly eliminates the overshoot current duration (step B) such that the compliance region (step C) completely dominates the forming energy. The randomness of the forming process insures that tBD will be different for both devices. As is shown in Fig. 3(a), device D3 formed before device D4. The resistances of these devices were then measured using a parameter analyzer. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the device that formed earlier, D3, has a lower Rform than the device that formed later, D4.",Main
"Strict minimizations of step B, as in case shown in Fig. 3, clearly lead to undesirable variability. The presence of Cp can reduce or even remove the dominance of step C. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the forming transients for four similar 1T-1R devices with Cp in the range of a few 10ï¿½ï¿½s of fF. This small insertion of Cp clearly reasserts the importance of step B as all these devices exhibit overshoot transients which persist for ï¿½ï¿½1 ns (full width at half maximum). Fig. 4(b) shows the post-forming resistance plot for the same devices in Fig. 4(a). Notice that unlike the step C-limited cases of Fig. 3(a), the re-introduction Cp and therefore step B destroyed the link between Rform and tBD which is intrinsically random.",Main
"With the captured waveforms shown in Fig. 4(a), the dissipated energy in step B and step C can be separated and calculated for each device. Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the relationship between the Rform (as measured in Fig. 4(b)) and the dissipated energy associated with step C and step B respectively. For clarity, the dissipated energy in Fig. 4(c) is normalized to the largest step C energy and the dissipated energy in Fig. 4(d) is normalized to the largest step B energy.",Main
"Fig. 4(c) shows no correlation, suggesting that Rform is no longer affected by the step C dissipated energy (as oppose to Fig. 3). A closer look reveals that Rform neither depends on the duration nor the amplitude of current during step C, indicating that the unpredictable tBD is no longer important",Main
"The entire V-shape trend of Fig. 4(d) as a function of step B energy has also been observed in greater detail (Fig. 5(a)) for the DP devices formed using ultra-short pulses such that step C is entirely absent [7]. Over a wide range of the lower dissipated energies, the increase in energy results in a more stable and robust lower resistance filament. While some data scatter does exist, the entire trend is remarkably systematic. Beyond a threshold energy value, further dissipated energy increases lead to an abrupt jump to higher resistance. This echoes the behavior of Fig. 4(d). Fig. 5(b) uses I-V characteristics to show that the jump from lower dissipated energy filaments to the much larger dissipated energy filaments is accompanied by a commensurate change from an ohmic to a non-ohmic characteristic, confirming the fundamental change in the filamentï¿½ï¿½s nature.",Main
"While Fig. 5 uses short pulses to control the duration of the overshoot, it is not necessary because the Cp directly affects the current overshoot duration (not the amplitude) [6]. This simple relationship makes parasitic capacitance an important control knob to tune the dissipated energy. The 1T-1R device model in [6] can be used to determine Cp derived overshoot duration to the step B dissipated energy relationship and thus provide a feedback to device layout. Optimized capacitance value may also be determined by characterizing an array of 1T-1R devices with varying capacitance. Various parameters such as endurance, retention or fluctuations may be used to define an optimized device performance. Since Cp is present in all combination of RRAM devices this method can be used to optimize the RRAM devices with selectors (1S-1R) as well.",Main
"This analysis clearly shows that greatly minimizing or even eliminating the parasitic capacitance is undesirable because it lets the randomness of tBD dominate the Rform values. Similarly, enhancing Cp is also undesirable because too much dissipated energy acts to dissolve/ anneal the filament. Thus, it is advantageous to optimize the parasitic capacitance to minimize the variability in Rform.",Main
"We show through simple forming transient analysis that purposeful inclusion of finite Cp can impart a bounded dissipated energy during filament formation. Instead of minimizing Cp, there is an optimum value which minimizes the variability in the resistance of the formed filament. In addition to reducing variability, parasitic optimization also opens the opportunity to better state control and avoids the undesirable low energy/current forming.",Summary

"We investigate the reset transition of HfO2-based RRAM structures with emphasis on revealing three-state resistive switching effects. We study nonpolar switching in Pt/HfO2/Pt and unipolar/bipolar switching in Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt structures, respectively. However, three-state resistive switching is only confirmed in the former case by means of various reset methodologies. Using two-step reset experiments it is shown that the transition to the complete reset state occurs at higher voltages if the CF first drops to the intermediate state.",Abstract
"Resistive Random Access Memories (RRAM), based on the resistive switching (RS) of transition metal oxide films (TMOs), such as NiO, TiO2, CuO, HfO2 and ZrO2, is one of the viable candidates for future nonvolatile memory applications due to their good scalability, long endurance, fast switching speed, and ease of integration in the back end of the line of CMOS technology [1?3]. The operating principle of RRAM is based on the reversible resistive switching (RS) between at least two stable resistance states, the high resistance state (HRS) and the low resistance state (LRS). In most cases, the RS effect has its origin in the creation, dissolution and rejuvenation of conductive filaments (CF), and this is believed to involve the formation, migration and recombination of oxygen vacancies or metal ions. Among all kinds of TMOs, HfO2 might be one of the most competitive RS functional materials for RRAM [4?7].",Introduction
"Understanding the physics of the RS phenomena is of great importance to control the performance, variability and reliability of these devices and to foster their real application as nonvolatile memories. In this regard, it is very important to reveal the nature of the CF, its conduction properties and the mechanisms which control its formation and disruption.",Introduction
"In this work, we focus on exploring the reset transition in HfO2- based RRAM structures, with the main goal of investigating threestate resistive switching effects. Recent experiments of unipolar switching in Pt/HfO2/Pt structures suggested the existence of an intermediate conduction state between the LRS and the HRS [8]. In this intermediate state, the CF was shown to behave roughly as a quantum wire (QW), showing conductance of the order of the quantum of conductance, G0  2e2=h. The idea that the CF in RRAM structures can be somehow understood as a QWwas already at the basis of the quantum point contact (QPC) which, though originally developed for soft and hard breakdown conduction paths in thin-oxide MOS devices [9], was recently shown to adequately describe the conduction of the CF both in the LRS and the HRS of RRAM structures based on filamentary switching [10?12]. Moreover, experimental evidence of conductance quantization has also been shown recently, both in devices based on the formation of a metallic CF through a solid electrolyte [13?15] and in RRAM structures with HfO2 as insulating material [8,16]. In the latter case, the CF is believed to be formed by oxygen vacancies and first-principle calculations have demonstrated the feasibility of oxygen-vacancy based CFs showing the properties of QWs [17].",Introduction
"To explore the phenomenology of three-state RS switching effects, we use different reset methodologies and explore both unipolar switching in symmetric Pt/HfO2/Pt structures and unipolar/bipolar switching in asymmetric Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt devices. Only in the first case, which shows a much higher ON/OFF resistance ratio, three different states of the CF are revealed in the reset cycles. This confirms previous three-state resistive switching results and suggests that the structure of the CF at the microscopic level is different in these two types of structures. In the case of Pt/HfO2/Pt structures, we also perform two-step reset experiments to show the impact of the intermediate state on the reset voltage and reset current statistical distributions.",Introduction
"The structures of Pt/HfO2/Pt and Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt with an area of 2.5 lm2 were fabricated onto a tungsten plug, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The 10-nm-thick HfO2 layer was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 350 C on the Pt bottom electrode (BE) prepared by physical vapor deposition (PVD), followed by the fabrication and pattering of the Pt or Pt/Ti top electrode (TE) using PVD and etching. The Pt/HfO2/Pt structure shows a nonpolar behavior, which means that both the set and the reset transitions can be produced by positive or negative bias. In these structures, however, we only study in detail the case of unipolar switching (i.e. set and reset is achieved by electrical stress of the same polarity). Some typical examples of unipolar set/reset cycles are shown in Fig. 1(b). In the case of Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt structures, the switching behavior is significantly different. The device only shows reliable switching performance when the reset is operated in the negative polarity, i.e., the Pt/Ti electrode is the cathode in the reset switching, in agreement with recent results of other authors [18]. This is likely because the Ti acts as an oxygen extraction layer which introduces a strongly non-uniform profile of oxygen vacancies (more vacancies near the Ti/HfO2 interface). In these structures, we will consider both the bipolar and the unipolar switching modes, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively. In all the experiments, the set transition was achieved by the application of a voltage ramp with a current compliance limit of 1 mA to avoid complete oxide breakdown. On the contrary, the reset transition was measured by three different electrical methods: constant-voltage stress (CVS), ramp-voltage sweep (RVS) and successive-voltage sweep (SVS) respectively. All the electrical measurements were performed with a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor characterization system.",Main
"Firstly, we consider the results of set/reset cycling experiments in which the reset was achieved by application of a ramp-voltage stress (RVS), which is the most widely used method for the investigation of the reset transition. These experiments have been performed in Pt/HfO2/Pt structures operated in the unipolar RS mode and in Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt structures operated under unipolar and bipolar stress conditions. The measured I(V) characteristics during 125 successive RVS reset cycles applied to the Pt/HfO2/Pt structure are shown in Fig. 2(a), as a representative example of the reset phenomenology under RVS method. In some cycles, this current drop is large enough to reach the HRS directly. In other cases, the drop is much smaller and it is followed by a more progressive reduction of the CF conductance. When the reset ramp finishes, two well defined bunches of conduction states are observed, one slightly above G0 and another one below  0.1G0.",Main
"The Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt devices were operated both in the bipolar (positive set and negative reset) and the unipolar (set and reset under negative polarity) switching modes. The histograms of lowvoltage conductance measured before and after set and reported in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. First we notice that the reset is much less effective than in the samples without Ti layer, in the sense that the conductance after reset is only at most slightly below G0. The results obtained under bipolar and unipolar reset conditions are indeed very similar and only one big peak is observed after the reset. Since this peak is centered at approximately 0.1G0 and its tail reaches conductance values above G0, we do not have evidence of the existence of the intermediate QW state in these structures. We believe that the differences in the reported conductance histograms reflect significant differences in the microscopic structure of the CF in both types of structures.Wespeculate that the CF might be rather symmetric in the case of unipolar switching of Pt/HfO2/Pt structure with the most constrictive region being located near the middle of the filament (hourglass shape) where the higher temperature is reached and favors CF dissolution during reset. On the other hand, in the asymmetric Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt structure, the CF might be significantly wider at the Ti/HfO2 interface (conical shape) due to the higher density of oxygen vacancies near this interface. This asymmetric CF might limit the extent to which the CF can be reset and make the observation of the intermediate QW state more difficult due to overlapping with the HRS state. Given these results, our study of the three-state RS effects has focused on the case of unipolar switching in Pt/HfO2/Pt structures.",Main
"In the previous section, we have concluded that the transitions to the intermediate QW state during reset experiments might reduce the probability of full reset of the CF to the HRS. To investigate this issue, we have designed two-step reset experiments consisting in a low-voltage CVS stage (0.55 V and 30 s) followed by a conventional RVS cycle. The goal of the initial CVS is to cause a transition from the LRS to the intermediate QW state in most of the samples. The final RVS reset properties are then compared with those obtained with an equivalent RVS reset experiment performed without the initial CVS. In this way, we obtain information about the impact of the QW state on the final transition to the HRS.",Main
"Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows the scatter plots of the final reset voltage (during the RVS) and final reset current, respectively. The impact of the initial CVS on the initial resistance of the CF is evident in these two figures. Except some cycles which remained in the LRS and showed CF initial resistances below 100 X, the rest of cycles suffered a transition from the LRS to the intermediate QW state and showed initial CF resistances well above this value and up to 104 X. This increase of initial CF resistance causes an increase of the reset voltage and a decrease of the reset current which is shown to be compatible with the thermal dissolution of the CF [19], as shown by the model lines in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The same results can also be represented in Fig. 6(c) and (d) in the form of cumulative distributions of reset voltage and reset current, respectively. These two figures show how the reset voltages are increased while the reset current decreases. However, since the thermal dissolution process is voltage controlled (the voltage determines the local temperature and hence the rate of diffusion of oxygen species), we can conclude that the transition to the intermediate QW state increases the stress requirements for the full transition to the HRS. The decrease of the reset current is fully determined by the increase of CF resistance associated to the transition from LRS to intermediate QW state. The increase of the voltage required to fully reset the CF to the HRS in those cycles that suffer the transition to the QW state needs to be accounted in the design of the reset operation to avoid reset failures related to this issue. Notice that this works has demonstrated that the transitions to the QW state occur under any kind of reset methodology. It is true that the probability of these transitions to the QW state are strongly suppressed at the high stress voltages required for fast pulse RRAM operation. However, these should anyhow be considered to increase the reset yield to high percentiles.",Main
"The existence of a QW state has been demonstrated for the resistive switching CF in Pt/HfO2/Pt devices. No clear evidence of this intermediate QW state is found in Pt/Ti/HfO2/Pt operated under unipolar or bipolar conditions. This might be due to the much lower resistances of the HRS achieved in these structures, likely related to the asymmetric shape of the CF. Different methods have been used for the reset including RVS, CVS and SVS. In all cases, experiments support the three-state RS phenomenon. Three states are identified for the CF: (1) the LRS, which corresponds to a wide CF with metallic properties; (2) a partial reset state in which the CF behaves as a QW; and (3) the HRS, in which a physical gap has been opened in the CF. The probability of full reset (transition from LRS to HRS) has been reported to increase with the applied voltage but in all the reported experiments a significant fraction of the CFs remains in the QW state. It has also been demonstrated that the transitions from the LRS to the QW state increases the voltage required for the full reset of the CF. Thus, this issue needs to be taken into account when designing reset operation algorithms.",Summary
